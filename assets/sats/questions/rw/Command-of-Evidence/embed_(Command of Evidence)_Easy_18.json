{"introduction": "Excerpt from Climate Control in Modern Office Buildings by Susan E. Harper", "text": "\"Researchers monitored employees\u2019 comfort levels in office spaces with adjustable climate control systems. Participants rated their comfort on a scale from -3 (very cold) to +3 (very hot), with 0 indicating neutral. According to the survey, all participants preferred a slightly warmer temperature, even though ______.\"", "question": "Which choice most effectively completes the statement?", "A": "some participants reported a comfort level of +2.", "B": "the majority reported comfort levels below zero.", "C": "each participant\u2019s comfort level was exactly the same.", "D": "a few participants reported feeling colder than others.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice D is correct because it suggests that most participants felt slightly cool (below zero) but still preferred a warmer temperature, aligning with the survey findings.\nChoice A is incorrect as it implies warmth rather than a preference for warming.\nChoice B is misleading because comfort levels usually vary between individuals.\nChoice C is incorrect, as it doesn\u2019t align with the overall preference for warmth."}
