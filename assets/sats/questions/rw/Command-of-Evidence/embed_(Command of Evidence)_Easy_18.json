	"introduction": "Excerpt from 'Advanced Robotics in Surgical Procedures' (2024)",
	"text": "Among the new generation of robotic surgical systems, micro-scale precision tools allow doctors to operate with minimal incisions. In trials comparing human-only procedures to hybrid operations (human surgeons assisted by micro-robots), complication rates decreased by 15%. However, researchers caution that relying too heavily on these automated tools could lead to skill atrophy among surgeons. Despite these reservations, the immediate benefits of faster patient recoveries and reduced post-operative infections cannot be ignored.",
	"question": "Which statement would the researchers most likely agree with regarding robotic assistance in surgery?",
	"A": "It has resulted in a complete elimination of surgical errors",
	"B": "It reduces complications but may diminish surgeonsâ€™ manual proficiency over time",
	"C": "It extends operation times due to slow, precise robotic movements",
	"D": "Its benefits are overshadowed by excessively high equipment costs",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the text highlights both the decrease in complication rates and the concern that surgeons could lose skill if they become overreliant on robots."
