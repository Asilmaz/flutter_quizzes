	"introduction": "Passage from 'Reevaluating the Symbolism of 19th-Century Poems' (2025)",
	"text": "Despite initial interpretations of Harriet Downing’s poem ‘Eclipsed Moon’ as a commentary on romantic despair, recent scholarship by Dr. Levenhouse argues it is an allegory of sociopolitical upheaval. Levenhouse points to references to ‘fractured crowns’ and ‘shadows devouring the stage of dawn’ as metaphors for faltering regimes. Traditional readers maintain the poem’s emotive language more closely aligns with private turmoil, yet Levenhouse counters that repeated allusions to public unrest indicate a broader, societal theme.",
	"question": "Which detail most strongly supports Levenhouse’s view of ‘Eclipsed Moon’ as an allegory of public upheaval?",
	"A": "Its frequent use of phrases related to heartbreak and isolation",
	"B": "Its mention of ‘fractured crowns’ symbolizing failing power structures",
	"C": "Its varied meter and structure that defy typical romantic conventions",
	"D": "Its historical publication date coinciding with the poet’s personal grief",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the phrase ‘fractured crowns’ is noted by Levenhouse as a metaphor for political collapse, supporting the allegorical interpretation of the poem as reflecting societal turmoil."
