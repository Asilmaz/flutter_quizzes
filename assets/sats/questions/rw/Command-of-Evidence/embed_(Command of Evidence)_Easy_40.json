{"introduction": "Excerpt from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "text": "\"In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Jane often feels isolated and struggles with her desire for companionship versus her need for independence. Her inner conflict is heightened by her complex feelings for Mr. Rochester, who offers her both affection and challenges to her self-reliance.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Jane Eyre</em> best illustrates Jane\u2019s internal struggle between her need for independence and her feelings for Mr. Rochester?", "A": "\u201cReader, I married him.\u201d", "B": "\u201cWherever you are is my home\u2014my only home.\u201d", "C": "\u201cI am not an angel, and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.\u201d", "D": "\u201cI care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice C is correct, as it captures Jane\u2019s determination to prioritize her independence, even if it means being alone, reflecting her internal struggle.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it emphasizes her individuality but not her conflict.\nChoice B is misleading, as it reflects her affection for Rochester without the internal struggle.\nChoice D is incorrect as it focuses on the conclusion, not her inner conflict."}
