{"introduction": "Excerpt from Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison", "text": "\"The narrator feels invisible in a society that refuses to acknowledge him. He describes this invisibility as both a burden and a source of freedom, allowing him to move unseen through a world that chooses to ignore him.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Invisible Man</em> best illustrates the narrator\u2019s sense of invisibility?", "A": "\u201cI am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.\u201d", "B": "\u201cI moved silently, watching but never truly being seen.\u201d", "C": "\u201cThey saw what they wanted to see, never what truly was.\u201d", "D": "\u201cIn the darkness, I found a strange sense of comfort.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is correct as it directly expresses the narrator\u2019s feeling of invisibility due to society\u2019s refusal to acknowledge him.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it implies movement without the specific reason for invisibility.\nChoice C is misleading, suggesting perception bias without conveying invisibility.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it focuses on comfort rather than the feeling of being unseen."}
