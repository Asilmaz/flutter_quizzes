{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain", "text": "\"Tom Sawyer, ever the mischievous boy, finds ways to turn tedious tasks into adventures. When faced with the chore of whitewashing a fence, he cleverly persuades other boys to do the work for him, turning a dull duty into an enjoyable game.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> best illustrates Tom\u2019s clever manipulation?", "A": "\u201cHe paused, watching with an expression of exaggerated interest.\u201d", "B": "\u201cWork consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s no fun.\u201d", "C": "\u201cThe paintbrush felt heavy in his hand, and he sighed at the thought of hours to go.\u201d", "D": "\u201cHe convinced them it was a privilege, not a chore, to paint the fence.\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice C is correct as it directly reflects Tom\u2019s cleverness in persuading others to paint the fence by making it seem enjoyable.\nChoice A is incorrect as it suggests interest but not manipulation.\nChoice B is misleading, as it reflects Tom\u2019s views on work but not his persuasion.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it implies reluctance rather than cleverness."}
