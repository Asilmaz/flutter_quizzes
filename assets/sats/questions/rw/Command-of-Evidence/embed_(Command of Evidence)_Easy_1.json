{"introduction": "Book Excerpt: The Life of Birds by David Attenborough", "text": "\"In the dense forests, hornbills face a unique challenge during nesting season. After finding a suitable tree hollow, the female hornbill seals herself inside, relying on her mate to bring food daily until the young are ready to emerge. This nesting habit helps protect the young but also requires exceptional coordination between mates.\"", "question": "Which of the following findings, if true, would most directly support Attenborough\u2019s claim about hornbill nesting behavior?", "A": "Male hornbills build their nests higher than other bird species, away from predators.", "B": "The hollow-sealing behavior is found in both male and female hornbills of a similar age.", "C": "Male hornbills who bring more food are found to have mates with higher chick survival rates.", "D": "Female hornbills only leave the nest when the chicks are mature enough to fly.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice D is correct because it aligns with the claim that the male hornbill\u2019s food provision plays a crucial role in chick survival, directly supporting the importance of the mate\u2019s role in this nesting behavior.\nChoice A is incorrect because nest height does not directly relate to the dependence of the female on the male for food.\nChoice B is incorrect as it describes chick behavior, not the interaction between mates during nesting.\nChoice C is incorrect because it focuses on the behavior being mutual rather than on the necessity of the male\u2019s role in provisioning food."}
