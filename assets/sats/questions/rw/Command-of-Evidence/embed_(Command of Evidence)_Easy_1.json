	"introduction": "Excerpt from 'Psychological Experiments on Memory Retention' (2021)",
	"text": "Dr. Kamori’s recent study on short-term and long-term memory revealed that participants who visualized new information retained it more effectively over one week than those who relied solely on rote repetition. However, participants who employed both visualization and spaced intervals of review performed best. Interestingly, participants who attempted mnemonic devices with little understanding of the content showed only marginal improvement compared to rote repetition alone.",
	"question": "Which method did Dr. Kamori’s study indicate provided the strongest overall memory retention?",
	"A": "Learning content purely via mnemonic devices",
	"B": "Using visualization techniques exclusively during study",
	"C": "Combining visualization with spaced review intervals",
	"D": "Rote memorization repeated hourly",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the text states that participants who used both visualization and spaced intervals of review had the best performance. The other options did not outperform this combined approach in the study."
