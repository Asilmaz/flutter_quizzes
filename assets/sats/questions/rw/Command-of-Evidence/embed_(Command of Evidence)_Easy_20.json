	"introduction": "Passage from 'Philosophical Debates on Technological Augmentation' (2024)",
	"text": "Sorenson’s argument posits that while neural implants can expand cognitive processing, there is a threshold beyond which human identity becomes nebulous. She suggests that as soon as a majority of cognitive functions are handled externally to the biological brain, individuality might be compromised. Opponents counter that humans have always relied on tools—albeit less invasive—to enhance thought, drawing parallels to writing or calculators. Sorenson, however, differentiates between passive aids and direct integration, stressing the profound psychological shift that may arise when technology fundamentally merges with one’s sense of self.",
	"question": "Why does Sorenson see direct technological integration as potentially more identity-altering than other tools?",
	"A": "It can never be removed once implanted, unlike traditional tools",
	"B": "It is more expensive, thus changing socioeconomic perspectives",
	"C": "It is actively merging with cognitive processes rather than simply assisting them externally",
	"D": "It is limited to a small group of specialized users at any given time",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the passage underlines that direct integration differs from passive external aids—technology literally merges with core cognitive functions, raising questions about the user’s personal identity."
