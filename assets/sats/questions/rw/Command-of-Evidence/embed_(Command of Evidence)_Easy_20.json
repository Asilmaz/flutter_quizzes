{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Power of Music in Education by Karen Blake", "text": "\"Educators who incorporate music into their teaching practices report that students are more engaged and perform better academically. For example, Mr. Lyle\u2019s class listens to classical music while solving math problems, and he observes a noticeable increase in focus and accuracy.\"", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support Blake\u2019s claim?", "A": "Students who enjoy music tend to have better academic outcomes overall.", "B": "Students in Mr. Lyle\u2019s class complete their math problems faster when listening to music.", "C": "Schools with music programs see higher overall attendance rates.", "D": "Teachers report that they feel more enthusiastic when using music in their lessons.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer as it directly supports the claim by showing a specific improvement (increased speed and focus) when music is incorporated into classroom activities.\nChoice A is incorrect because it suggests a general correlation, not an effect of music in the classroom.\nChoice B is misleading, as attendance rates are unrelated to classroom performance.\nChoice D is incorrect since teacher enthusiasm does not directly support student engagement or performance improvements."}
