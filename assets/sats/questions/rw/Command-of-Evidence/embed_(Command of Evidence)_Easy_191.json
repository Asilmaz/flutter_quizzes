{"introduction": "Excerpt from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville", "text": "\"Captain Ahab\u2019s obsession with killing the white whale, Moby Dick, dominates his thoughts and actions. His relentless pursuit blinds him to the risks he imposes on himself and his crew, as he becomes increasingly consumed by vengeance.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Moby-Dick</em> best illustrates Ahab\u2019s all-consuming obsession?", "A": "\u201cI\u2019ll follow him round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up.\u201d", "B": "\u201cThe open sea lay before them, silent and endless.\u201d", "C": "\u201cAhab\u2019s thoughts turned to shore, to the life he had left behind.\u201d", "D": "\u201cHe felt no fear, only a strange calm that grew with each passing day.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is correct, as it directly reflects Ahab\u2019s obsessive vow to pursue Moby Dick at any cost, showing his single-minded determination.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it describes the sea without reference to Ahab\u2019s obsession.\nChoice C is misleading, suggesting calm rather than intense fixation.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it implies nostalgia rather than obsession."}
