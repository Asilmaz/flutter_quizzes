{"introduction": "Book Excerpt: \"The Wizarding Apprentice\" (2020)", "text": "In the world of Calymera, apprentices learn the ancient art of wizardry by mastering a series of skills, starting with basic potions and progressing to more complex spells. As a new apprentice, Mara struggled most with _____, although she found a surprising aptitude for elemental spells and enchantments. She continued her studies, however, determined to overcome this challenge.", "question": "Based on the information in the excerpt, which skill was Mara most likely struggling with as an apprentice?", "A": "casting powerful spells", "B": "mastering elemental spells", "C": "enchanting magical objects", "D": "creating basic potions", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the excerpt specifically mentions that Mara is learning wizardry skills in a particular order, starting with \"basic potions.\" It also states that she struggled with one of the skills, though she was adept at \"elemental spells and enchantments,\" making potions the most likely challenge.\nChoice A is incorrect because it suggests a high-level skill, whereas Mara is in the early stages of training.\nChoice C is misleading because although she had an aptitude for enchantments, it wasn't indicated as a struggle.\nChoice D is incorrect as it is explicitly stated she had a natural ability with elemental spells."}
