	"introduction": "Excerpt from 'Colonial Mercantile Strategies' (2022)",
	"text": "During the mid-eighteenth century, a series of treaties redefined the boundaries of several colonial powers. Merchants operating in newly acquired port cities were forced to adapt to stricter taxation policies, leading to unexpected shifts in trade patterns. Records show that while some ports thrived under the new agreements, others saw a rapid decline in revenue and merchant activity. Historians suggest that the deciding factor was the local administrationâ€™s willingness to accommodate foreign traders with relaxed documentation requirements and easier access to warehouses.",
	"question": "Based on the excerpt, which factor most influenced the success of certain port cities after the mid-eighteenth-century treaties?",
	"A": "The severity of new tax impositions relative to earlier tariffs",
	"B": "The adaptation of local governance to accommodate foreign merchants",
	"C": "The competition between local merchants and established colonial enterprises",
	"D": "The cost of shipping routes controlled by rival colonial powers",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the excerpt explicitly mentions that local administrations that offered relaxed documentation and easier storage options helped foreign traders thrive. The other choices focus on general factors mentioned but not singled out as the deciding influence in the excerpt."
