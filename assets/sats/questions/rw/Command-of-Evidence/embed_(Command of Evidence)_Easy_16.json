{"introduction": "Excerpt from Glaciers and Climate Change by Mark T. Anderson", "text": "\"The melting rates of glaciers around the world vary significantly due to factors like altitude and regional temperature changes. In recent studies, scientists have measured the ice loss in glaciers in Alaska, the Andes, and the Himalayas, revealing that the ______ glacier experienced the most significant area reduction.\"", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses data on glacier melting to complete the statement?", "A": "Himalayan", "B": "Alaskan", "C": "Andean", "D": "Arctic", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because studies have shown that Alaskan glaciers, especially those at lower altitudes, experience rapid melting rates, making them highly susceptible to area reduction.\nChoice B is incorrect because Andean glaciers, while shrinking, generally experience slower melting rates.\nChoice C is misleading, as Himalayan glaciers are affected but not as dramatically as Alaskan ones.\nChoice D is incorrect; Arctic ice sheets are distinct from glaciers and follow different melting patterns."}
