	"text": "Dr. Morales examined the correlation between increasing temperatures and the spread of pest insects in northern conifer forests. While pests were historically limited by harsh winters, recent climatic trends have allowed them to survive longer, accelerating tree damage. However, Morales found that some conifer species produced a protective resin in higher quantities when exposed to moderate pest levels. The sudden collapse in pest-control balance appears linked to unusually mild winters, leaving the conifers vulnerable to infestations at scale.",
	"question": "What condition primarily enabled pest insects to proliferate extensively in the northern conifer forests?",
	"A": "Excessive resin production weakening certain conifer species",
	"B": "Year-round mild temperatures preventing typical winter die-off",
	"C": "Complete absence of natural predators in the ecosystem",
	"D": "Human intervention introducing invasive pest species",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the text states that pests historically died off in harsh winters, but milder winters have let them survive longer and thereby spread more widely."
