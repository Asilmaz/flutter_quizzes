{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Decline of Print Media in the Digital Age by Allison Kent", "text": "\"Since the early 2000s, print newspaper circulation in the U.S. has seen a steady decline. Many publishers are shifting to digital platforms, which offer lower distribution costs and a wider reach. According to recent data, daily print circulation has fallen to less than half of its 2005 levels.\"", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the excerpt to illustrate the decline in print circulation?", "A": "Daily print circulation in 2005 was approximately 15 million, but only 7 million in 2020.", "B": "Newspaper circulation rose slightly from 2000 to 2005, before any major decline.", "C": "The popularity of print newspapers stabilized after 2005, even with digital alternatives.", "D": "Print newspapers saw the same number of subscribers in 2010 as in 2005.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it provides specific data showing a decline in print circulation, supporting the excerpt\u2019s discussion of reduced print readership.\nChoice B is incorrect because it suggests a rise rather than a decline.\nChoice C is misleading, implying consistency rather than a decrease.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it suggests stability, which contradicts the declining trend mentioned in the excerpt."}
