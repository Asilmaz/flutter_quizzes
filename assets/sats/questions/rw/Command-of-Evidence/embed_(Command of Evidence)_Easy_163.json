{"introduction": "Excerpt from 1984 by George Orwell", "text": "\"In a society governed by constant surveillance, Winston Smith longs for freedom and individuality. His quiet rebellion against the oppressive Party begins with small acts of defiance, as he struggles to hold on to his sense of self in a world that seeks to erase it.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>1984</em> best illustrates Winston\u2019s desire for individuality?", "A": "\u201cHe was nothing more than a tiny figure in the vast machinery of the Party.\u201d", "B": "\u201cThe Party\u2019s words filled the air, leaving no room for independent thought.\u201d", "C": "\u201cFreedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\u201d", "D": "\u201cHe tried to blend into the crowd, keeping his head low and his thoughts hidden.\u201d", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is correct as it directly expresses Winston\u2019s desire for freedom and individuality, emphasizing his wish to think independently.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it suggests concealment rather than individuality.\nChoice C is misleading, as it emphasizes the Party\u2019s control but not Winston\u2019s desire for individuality.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it reflects his insignificance rather than his longing for freedom."}
