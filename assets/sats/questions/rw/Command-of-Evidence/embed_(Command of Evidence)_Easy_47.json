{"introduction": "Excerpt from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky", "text": "\"Raskolnikov, burdened by guilt and a troubled conscience, becomes increasingly paranoid and withdrawn after committing murder. His inner turmoil manifests in intense anxiety and self-doubt, making him suspicious of those around him.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Crime and Punishment</em> best illustrates Raskolnikov\u2019s paranoia and guilt?", "A": "\u201cHe felt a strange satisfaction in his isolation from society.\u201d", "B": "\u201cI am a trembling creature, and only on that account do I consider myself guilty.\u201d", "C": "\u201cNo matter how far he walked, his footsteps echoed in his mind.\u201d", "D": "\u201cHe looked at everyone as though they could see the crime etched on his face.\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is correct because it directly captures Raskolnikov\u2019s paranoia, as he fears others can see his guilt, showing his intense anxiety.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it reflects guilt but not paranoia.\nChoice C is misleading, focusing on isolation rather than anxiety.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it implies reflection rather than guilt-driven paranoia."}
