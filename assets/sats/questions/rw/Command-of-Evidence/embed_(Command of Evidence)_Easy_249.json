{"introduction": "Excerpt from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville", "text": "\"Captain Ahab is driven by a consuming desire for revenge against the white whale, Moby Dick, who took his leg. His obsession blinds him to reason and the dangers it poses to himself and his crew, pushing him toward a tragic end.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Moby-Dick</em> best illustrates Ahab\u2019s obsessive need for revenge?", "A": "\u201cI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where\u2019er I sail.\u201d", "B": "\u201cHis crew followed, though they feared the madness that drove him.\u201d", "C": "\u201cI\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up.\u201d", "D": "\u201cThe sea was vast, but Ahab saw only the path to his prey.\u201d", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is correct as it directly conveys Ahab\u2019s relentless pursuit and obsession with revenge, emphasizing his vow to chase Moby Dick at any cost.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it suggests melancholy but not obsession.\nChoice C is misleading, showing focus without the specific intent of revenge.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it highlights his crew\u2019s reaction rather than his obsession."}
