	"introduction": "From 'Phonetics and Language Evolution Studies' (2023)",
	"text": "Professor Adamiâ€™s linguistic survey of isolated mountain communities revealed unexpected retention of archaic vowels absent in mainstream dialects for centuries. Her team recorded consistent pronouncing patterns that matched historical texts, suggesting limited external influence preserved these sounds. While cultural isolation contributed to this conservation, Adami also believes community pride in older speech forms prevented assimilation into more common pronunciations.",
	"question": "Which factor, according to Professor Adami, helped preserve the archaic vowels in these mountain communities?",
	"A": "Access to modern linguistic software for self-study",
	"B": "Influence from neighboring, more cosmopolitan areas",
	"C": "Community pride that discouraged adopting contemporary speech",
	"D": "Frequent immigration bringing diverse language forms into the region",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the passage states that community pride in older speech, alongside geographic isolation, contributed to retaining the archaic vowel forms."
