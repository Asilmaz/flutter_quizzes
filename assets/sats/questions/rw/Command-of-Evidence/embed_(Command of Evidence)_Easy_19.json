{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Amazon's Secret Hunters by Rodrigo Maia", "text": "\"Biologists traditionally believed that jaguars in the Amazon primarily hunted mammals, but recent studies suggest that they may consume more fish and aquatic animals than previously thought. Researchers analyzed the remains found in areas frequently visited by jaguars.\"", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 claim?", "A": "Jaguars are rarely seen hunting during daylight hours.", "B": "Jaguar populations are higher in areas with abundant aquatic prey.", "C": "Fish scales and bones are found more often than mammal remains in jaguar scat.", "D": "Jaguars in the Amazon live closer to rivers and water sources.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer, as finding fish remains in jaguar scat supports the claim that jaguars consume more aquatic prey.\nChoice A is incorrect because it implies habitat preference rather than diet specifics.\nChoice B is misleading, as hunting time doesn\u2019t confirm dietary habits.\nChoice D is incorrect, as proximity to water doesn\u2019t directly prove dietary shifts."}
