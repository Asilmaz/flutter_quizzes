{"introduction": "Excerpt from Environmental Studies of Desert Flora by Dr. Michael Langford", "text": "\"In deserts, plants have adapted to survive in arid conditions by developing unique water-storing capabilities. For instance, some cacti can store hundreds of liters of water, allowing them to endure extended periods of drought. The table below shows water retention capacities of common desert plants.\"", "question": "Based on the data, which desert plant has the highest water retention capacity?", "A": "Saguaro cactus", "B": "Yucca", "C": "Barrel cactus", "D": "Prickly pear", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice B is correct because the saguaro cactus, known for its high water retention, aligns with the excerpt\u2019s description of cacti capable of storing hundreds of liters.\nChoice A is incorrect as yucca plants do not store as much water.\nChoice C is misleading, as barrel cacti store water but not as much as the saguaro.\nChoice D is incorrect since prickly pears have lower water storage capacity."}
