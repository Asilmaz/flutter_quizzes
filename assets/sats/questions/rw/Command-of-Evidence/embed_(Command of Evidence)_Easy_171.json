{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain", "text": "\"Huck grapples with his conscience as he decides whether to help Jim, a runaway slave, gain freedom. His internal conflict reflects the values he was raised with, which tell him that helping Jim is wrong, versus his own growing sense of morality.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> best illustrates Huck\u2019s moral dilemma?", "A": "\u201cI felt all washed and clean of sin for the first time in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.\u201d", "B": "\u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll go to hell \u2013 and tore it up.\u201d", "C": "\u201cIt made me feel so mean, seeing him look like that, and I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d", "D": "\u201cJim was my friend, but something inside told me I had to turn him in.\u201d", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice C is correct as it captures Huck\u2019s decision to defy societal expectations, even if he believes it will condemn him, illustrating his moral struggle.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it implies redemption rather than conflict.\nChoice B is misleading, as it reflects empathy but lacks decisive moral struggle.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it hints at a struggle but not his firm resolution."}
