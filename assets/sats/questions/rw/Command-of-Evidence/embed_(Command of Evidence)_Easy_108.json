{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger", "text": "\"Holden Caulfield frequently criticizes the \u2018phoniness\u2019 he perceives in the people around him. His disdain for insincerity leaves him feeling isolated and disconnected from a world he believes lacks genuine honesty and compassion.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> best illustrates Holden\u2019s disillusionment with people\u2019s insincerity?", "A": "\u201cThe crowded room made him feel more alone than ever.\u201d", "B": "\u201cHe watched them laugh, but he felt nothing in return.\u201d", "C": "\u201cIt\u2019s full of phonies, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d", "D": "\u201cPeople were always pretending, but he could see right through them.\u201d", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is correct, as it directly reflects Holden\u2019s belief that society is filled with \u2018phonies\u2019 and highlights his strong disdain for insincerity.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it implies detachment but not specific criticism of phoniness.\nChoice C is misleading, suggesting perception without outright disdain.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it emphasizes isolation rather than his view on insincerity."}
