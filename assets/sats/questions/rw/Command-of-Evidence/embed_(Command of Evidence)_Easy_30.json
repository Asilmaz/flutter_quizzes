{"introduction": "Excerpt from Guide to Native Plants of North America by Dr. Laura Greene", "text": "\"A botanist is researching trees native to North America that are known for their short height and adaptability. The table lists various tree types, including each tree\u2019s maximum height and whether it is native to North America. The botanist seeks a native tree under 30 feet.\"", "question": "Which choice most effectively completes the botanist's search?", "A": "Sugar maple", "B": "White oak", "C": "Silver maple", "D": "Eastern redbud", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is correct because the Eastern redbud is a native North American tree with a maximum height under 30 feet, meeting the botanist\u2019s criteria.\nChoice A is incorrect as sugar maples grow taller than 30 feet.\nChoice C is misleading, as white oaks reach much greater heights.\nChoice D is incorrect since silver maples also exceed 30 feet."}
