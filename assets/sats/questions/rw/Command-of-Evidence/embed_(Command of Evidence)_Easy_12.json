	"introduction": "From 'Behavioral Economics and Decision Fatigue' (2021)",
	"text": "In a controlled study, participants faced a series of choices throughout the day, ranging from simple preferences (like snack flavors) to complex ethical dilemmas. Those who made several high-stakes decisions earlier showed a tendency to default to safer, less innovative choices afterward, a phenomenon researchers dubbed ‘cumulative caution.’ Interestingly, those given brief rest intervals with non-cognitive tasks demonstrated higher tolerance for risk in later challenges, suggesting that mental replenishment counters decision fatigue.",
	"question": "What phenomenon did researchers identify in participants who made many high-stakes decisions consecutively?",
	"A": "They exhibited increased creativity in subsequent tasks",
	"B": "They defaulted to safer choices as the day progressed",
	"C": "They required substantially more time to make each decision",
	"D": "They consistently embraced riskier choices after each high-stakes round",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the text describes ‘cumulative caution,’ whereby participants tend to become more conservative as they face repeated significant decisions without rest."
