{"introduction": "Excerpt from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "text": "\"Jane Eyre, though deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, refuses to compromise her principles. When she learns the truth about his past, she is faced with a painful decision, choosing to leave rather than sacrifice her self-respect and integrity.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Jane Eyre</em> best illustrates Jane\u2019s commitment to her principles?", "A": "\u201cI care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\u201d", "B": "\u201cHer heart ached, but she knew she must follow her own path.\u201d", "C": "\u201cHe begged her to stay, yet her resolve did not waver.\u201d", "D": "\u201cThe decision left her hollow, yet she did not look back.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is correct as it directly conveys Jane\u2019s commitment to her own integrity and self-respect, showing her strength in prioritizing her principles.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it suggests independence without the emphasis on principles.\nChoice C is misleading, showing determination but not the underlying value of integrity.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it reflects sadness but lacks a focus on principles."}
