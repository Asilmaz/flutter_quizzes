{"introduction": "Excerpt from Energy Alternatives: A Global Perspective by Richard E. Wolf", "text": "\"In regions relying on solar power, energy production can vary significantly with weather conditions. When sunlight intensity exceeds predictions, solar power facilities can generate more energy than expected, providing a boost to local power supplies. For example, during the summer, one facility in Nevada was able to ______.\"", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses the context to complete the statement?", "A": "operate at minimal levels due to intense heat.", "B": "provide consistent energy output despite fluctuating sunlight.", "C": "produce extra energy to meet higher-than-expected demand.", "D": "produce less electricity due to a drop in sunlight hours.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it aligns with the context of producing more energy due to higher sunlight intensity, supporting local power needs.\nChoice A is incorrect because longer summer sunlight usually boosts, not decreases, energy output.\nChoice B is misleading, as fluctuating sunlight wouldn\u2019t typically lead to consistent energy output.\nChoice D is incorrect, as intense heat does not necessarily reduce solar power generation."}
