	"introduction": "Excerpt from 'Economic Theories of Labor Shifts' (2021)",
	"text": "Economist Tamarov argued that the mid-century decline in factory employment within certain regions was not solely due to automation. Instead, Tamarov showed that changing consumer preferences, fluctuating currency values, and the rise of the service sector contributed equally to the workforce realignment. However, surveys indicate that many workers blame direct job displacement by machinery, overlooking other economic variables.",
	"question": "Which factor did Tamarov specifically challenge as the sole cause of mid-century factory employment decline?",

	"B": "Changing consumer demands",
	"C": "Automation-driven job loss",
	"D": "Growth of the service sector",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the text explicitly states that Tamarov argues the decline was not solely due to automation, contradicting the common belief that machine replacement was the single cause."
