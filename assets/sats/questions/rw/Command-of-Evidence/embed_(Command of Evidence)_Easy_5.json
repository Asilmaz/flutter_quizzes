{"introduction": "Excerpt from Silent Spring by Rachel Carson", "text": "\"In her work, Carson raised awareness about the environmental consequences of pesticide use, particularly DDT, and how it impacted bird populations. She argued that the decline in birds was not merely a natural fluctuation but was influenced by human activity. Carson\u2019s work reached beyond scientists to a wider audience, sparking discussions about conservation.\"", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support Carson's argument about pesticide impact on bird populations?", "A": "Some bird species began migrating later in the year due to climate change.", "B": "The lifespan of songbirds was found to be shorter in colder climates.", "C": "Populations of certain birds increased in areas with low pesticide usage.", "D": "Some birds adapted by building nests in urban areas to avoid predators.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B best supports Carson's argument by showing that bird populations increased where pesticides were minimally used, suggesting a link between pesticide use and population decline.\nChoice A is incorrect as it attributes changes in migration to climate, not pesticides.\nChoice C is misleading, as it addresses lifespan changes due to climate, unrelated to pesticides.\nChoice D is incorrect because it focuses on nesting behavior, not pesticide impact on populations."}
