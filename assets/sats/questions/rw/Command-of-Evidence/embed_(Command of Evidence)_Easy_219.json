{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald", "text": "\"Jay Gatsby is consumed by his dream of rekindling his love with Daisy Buchanan, an ideal he clings to despite the passing years. His devotion blinds him to the reality of their differences and the impossibility of truly recreating the past.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Great Gatsby</em> best illustrates Gatsby\u2019s idealistic obsession with Daisy?", "A": "\u201cHe gazed at her, hoping to see the girl he remembered.\u201d", "B": "\u201cThe grandeur of his parties meant little without her.\u201d", "C": "\u201cFor him, she was a symbol of everything he\u2019d lost.\u201d", "D": "\u201cCan\u2019t repeat the past?\u2026 Why of course you can!\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is correct as it directly captures Gatsby\u2019s belief that he can recreate the past with Daisy, illustrating his unrealistic fixation on his idealized vision.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it implies longing without his belief in recreating the past.\nChoice C is misleading, reflecting the emptiness of his parties without his obsession with the past.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it highlights symbolism rather than his determination to relive the past."}
