{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Rise of Renaissance Art by Thomas R. Walsh", "text": "\"Renaissance artists broke away from medieval traditions by embracing realism and the study of human anatomy. Painters like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo meticulously observed the human form to create lifelike portrayals, distinguishing Renaissance art with its focus on accuracy and depth.\"", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support Walsh\u2019s claim about the Renaissance focus on realism?", "A": "Michelangelo primarily painted scenes of mythical creatures in his early career.", "B": "Renaissance painters rarely depicted religious figures in their artwork.", "C": "Artists during the Renaissance used brighter colors than in medieval art.", "D": "Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s sketches show detailed studies of human muscles and bones.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is correct because da Vinci\u2019s detailed anatomical sketches directly support the claim that Renaissance artists focused on realism and accurate portrayal of the human body.\nChoice A is incorrect as mythical themes don\u2019t support the focus on realism.\nChoice C is misleading, as religious figures were still common in Renaissance art.\nChoice D is incorrect as color choice does not directly relate to realism."}
