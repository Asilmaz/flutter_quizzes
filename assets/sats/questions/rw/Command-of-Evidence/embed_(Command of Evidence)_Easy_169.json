{"introduction": "Excerpt from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen", "text": "\"Elizabeth Bennet initially judges Mr. Darcy as arrogant and aloof, based on his dismissive attitude at a ball. However, as she learns more about him, her perception begins to shift, leading her to question her initial impressions.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> best illustrates Elizabeth\u2019s evolving view of Mr. Darcy?", "A": "\u201cPerhaps, she thought, she had been too quick to judge his actions.\u201d", "B": "\u201cShe could not avoid thinking him at least tolerable, though far from admirable.\u201d", "C": "\u201cElizabeth glanced at him with renewed admiration, though she kept her thoughts private.\u201d", "D": "\u201cMr. Darcy\u2019s silence gave her no clue as to his true character.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice B is correct as it directly reflects Elizabeth\u2019s reconsideration of her first impression of Darcy, highlighting her changing perception.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it suggests minimal acceptance rather than a shift in perception.\nChoice C is misleading, suggesting admiration without a clear change in viewpoint.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it emphasizes ambiguity rather than her evolving view."}
