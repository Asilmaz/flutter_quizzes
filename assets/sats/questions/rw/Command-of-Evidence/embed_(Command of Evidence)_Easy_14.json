	"introduction": "Excerpt from 'Botanical Adaptations in Desert Climates' (2023)",
	"text": "The ferro cactus, newly observed in arid plateaus, exhibits a remarkable strategy: small, reflective spines that direct excess heat away from its core tissues. Soil analyses suggest these cacti thrive in regions with high mineral content, but the reflective spines are what distinguish them from other desert flora. Botanists propose that their reflective quality may limit water loss, though the exact process of heat deflection is not yet fully understood. Some speculate microstructures in the spines form a prism-like arrangement scattering sunlight.",
	"question": "According to the excerpt, which feature most sets the ferro cactus apart from other desert plants?",
	"A": "Thicker roots allowing deeper water absorption",
	"B": "Reflective spines that possibly reduce heat stress",
	"C": "Its reliance on low-mineral soil for nutrient uptake",
	"D": "Rapid flowering cycles triggered by brief rainfall",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the text explicitly highlights the ferro cactusâ€™s reflective spines as the unique adaptation distinguishing it from other desert flora. The other points are not cited as unique to this species."
