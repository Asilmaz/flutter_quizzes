{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett", "text": "\"In <em>The Secret Garden</em>, Burnett describes the secluded garden as a place of tranquility and near-silence, adding to its mysterious and magical atmosphere. Here, the characters often find themselves surrounded by a peaceful quiet that allows them to connect deeply with nature.\"", "question": "Which quotation from <em>The Secret Garden</em> most effectively illustrates the theme of tranquility and quiet in the garden?", "A": "\u201cThe robin flew down to perch on a branch, chirping lively as the sun rose.\u201d", "B": "\u201cMary and Dickon laughed as they tended to the growing flowers.\u201d", "C": "\u201cThe wind howled outside, yet inside the garden, it was still and calm.\u201d", "D": "\u201cShe could hear nothing but the soft rustle of leaves moving gently in the breeze.\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer, as it directly conveys the sense of quiet and peacefulness in the garden, aligning with the theme of tranquility.\nChoice A is incorrect because the lively chirping suggests activity rather than quiet.\nChoice C is misleading, focusing on human interaction rather than the garden\u2019s peaceful atmosphere.\nChoice D is incorrect as it contrasts external noise with internal calm without emphasizing tranquility."}
