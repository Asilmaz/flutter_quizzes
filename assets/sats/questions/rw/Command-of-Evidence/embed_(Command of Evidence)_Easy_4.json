{
	"introduction": "Excerpt from a 'Journal of Ethnomusicology' article (2025)",
	"text": "Across several remote villages, field researchers documented a shared musical scale used in ceremonial songs, despite substantial differences in language and cultural practice. It is hypothesized that centuries-old trading routes may have facilitated the spread of these scales, which were then adapted to local traditions. Skeptics question whether these similarities truly indicate a shared origin or whether human auditory preferences predispose communities to develop parallel musical structures independently.",
	"question": "According to the excerpt, which factor is proposed to have influenced the widespread use of a similar musical scale among distant villages?",
	"A": "The universal biological foundation of music perception",
	"B": "Ancient trade connections leading to cultural exchange",
	"C": "A deliberate mandate imposed by regional authorities",
	"D": "Coincidental convergence arising from random chance",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the text specifically suggests that centuries-old trading routes may have enabled the spread of the musical scale. The other options are either speculative or not referenced."
