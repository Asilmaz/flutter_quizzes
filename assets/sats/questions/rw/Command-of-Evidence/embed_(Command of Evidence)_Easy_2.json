	"introduction": "From 'Architectural Innovations in the Late 1800s' (2023)",
	"text": "As steel became more affordable, architects started experimenting with taller and more open structures. In many urban centers, multi-story buildings featuring steel skeletons replaced smaller brick constructions. Contemporary critics praised the newfound architectural freedom but worried about losing aesthetic variety, as many of these new buildings shared remarkably similar façades. Some historians argue that the emphasis on efficiency, rather than ornamental detail, signaled a broader cultural shift prioritizing practicality over tradition.",
	"question": "Which concern did contemporary critics express about the new steel-based architecture?",
	"A": "Excessive building height posing safety hazards",
	"B": "Diminishing diversity in outward building design",
	"C": "Rapidly escalating construction costs for urban centers",
	"D": "Increasing difficulty maintaining steel frameworks",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the excerpt specifically notes that critics worried these buildings had ‘remarkably similar façades,’ suggesting a lack of aesthetic variety. Other choices are not mentioned as primary concerns."
