{"introduction": "Book Excerpt: My \u00c1ntonia by Willa Cather", "text": "\"In the book, \u00c1ntonia is described as having a deep, abiding bond with her homeland on the prairie, a connection that defines her character. She finds a sense of strength and renewal in the wide-open landscape, even as seasons change and hardships arise.\"", "question": "Which quotation from <em>My \u00c1ntonia</em> most effectively illustrates \u00c1ntonia's connection to the land?", "A": "\"\u00c1ntonia was happiest when she was with the neighbors, talking and laughing in the fields.\"", "B": "\"Whenever \u00c1ntonia walked through the town square, she admired the bustling life around her.\"", "C": "\"She would often say that the sun felt like an old friend, warming her as she worked.\"", "D": "\"She spent most evenings by the fireplace, recounting tales of faraway places.\"", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it reflects \u00c1ntonia\u2019s personal connection to the natural landscape, emphasizing how the sun and land provide her with warmth and companionship.\nChoice A is incorrect because it highlights \u00c1ntonia\u2019s social relationships rather than her bond with the land.\nChoice C is misleading as it shows her appreciation for town life, not the prairie.\nChoice D is incorrect because it describes her interest in storytelling rather than her connection to the natural environment."}
