{"introduction": "Excerpt from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky", "text": "\"Raskolnikov is consumed by guilt after committing a crime, and his inner turmoil leads him to question his beliefs and motives. His guilt manifests as paranoia and self-loathing, affecting his ability to live a normal life and haunting him relentlessly.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Crime and Punishment</em> best illustrates Raskolnikov\u2019s intense guilt?", "A": "\u201cRaskolnikov looked away, hiding from his own reflection.\u201d", "B": "\u201cThe city seemed darker, though nothing had changed.\u201d", "C": "\u201cHe felt as if every gaze held a hidden accusation, piercing his soul.\u201d", "D": "\u201cEach step felt heavier, but he could not understand why.\u201d", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is correct, as it directly captures Raskolnikov\u2019s paranoia and feeling of guilt, suggesting that he feels accused and haunted by his actions.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it hints at darkness without directly connecting to guilt.\nChoice C is misleading, suggesting unease but lacking intensity.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it implies avoidance without illustrating guilt explicitly."}
