{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde", "text": "\"Dorian Gray, captivated by his own beauty, makes a wish to remain young while his portrait ages instead. His desire to avoid the consequences of his actions leads him down a path of moral corruption, as he prioritizes pleasure and vanity over integrity.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> best illustrates Dorian\u2019s willingness to sacrifice morality for eternal youth?", "A": "\u201cThe portrait grew darker, yet he felt no shame.\u201d", "B": "\u201cIf it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!\u201d", "C": "\u201cHe laughed at the idea of sin, for he believed his beauty would protect him.\u201d", "D": "\u201cDorian knew he was changed, but only his heart carried the weight.\u201d", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is correct, as it directly reflects Dorian\u2019s wish to stay young at any moral cost, setting up his disregard for consequences.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it shows arrogance but not the exact nature of his wish.\nChoice C is misleading, hinting at change but lacking the initial desire for youth.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it reflects self-awareness rather than his wish for eternal youth."}
