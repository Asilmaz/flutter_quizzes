	"introduction": "From 'Cognitive Approaches to Literary Analysis' (2022)",
	"text": "Authors who experiment heavily with narrative structure often engage readers’ working memories more intensively. Dr. Koehler found that frequent perspective shifts and nonlinear timelines can either captivate or repel readers, depending on the reader’s comfort with ambiguity. Interestingly, participants who thrived on puzzles and complex tasks reported higher enjoyment of disjointed narratives, whereas those who preferred straightforward plots often experienced frustration.",
	"question": "What aspect of narrative experimentation does Dr. Koehler identify as a key factor in reader response?",
	"A": "The historical context in which the story is set",
	"B": "The frequency of shifting perspectives and non-linear timelines",
	"C": "The clarity of the author’s thematic messaging",
	"D": "The length of time between major plot developments",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the study emphasizes how perspective changes and non-linear structures directly impact how readers perceive and enjoy a story. Other aspects are not highlighted as determining factors for reader response."
