{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Behavior of Wolves in the Wild by Dr. Samuel Greer", "text": "\"Pack dynamics among wolves play a crucial role in hunting strategies. The alpha wolves typically lead the hunt, while others coordinate to surround prey. This cooperative strategy increases their chances of capturing larger animals than they could individually.\"", "question": "Which observation, if true, would best support Dr. Greer\u2019s claim about wolf pack cooperation?", "A": "Wolves tend to hunt individually when food is abundant.", "B": "Alpha wolves take the largest share of the captured prey.", "C": "Lone wolves are rarely able to capture large prey.", "D": "Wolf packs are more successful at capturing prey in summer than in winter.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer as it shows that individual wolves struggle to capture large prey, supporting the claim that cooperative hunting within a pack is advantageous.\nChoice A is incorrect as it describes behavior unrelated to cooperation.\nChoice C is misleading, focusing on food distribution rather than cooperation.\nChoice D is incorrect as it describes seasonal success rather than cooperative dynamics."}
