{"introduction": "Excerpt from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb", "text": "\"Heathcliff\u2019s intense and often destructive passion for Catherine Earnshaw consumes him, leading him to actions that isolate him from others. His feelings for Catherine are deeply intertwined with resentment and longing, shaping his behavior toward those around him.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Wuthering Heights</em> best illustrates Heathcliff\u2019s obsessive love for Catherine?", "A": "\u201cHe had a morose, brooding expression that made people avoid him.\u201d", "B": "\u201cHe seemed to take pleasure in others\u2019 discomfort, particularly if they opposed him.\u201d", "C": "\u201cMy love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it.\u201d", "D": "\u201cI cannot live without my soul!\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is correct because it directly expresses Heathcliff\u2019s profound and obsessive connection to Catherine, emphasizing his inability to live without her.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it describes his appearance rather than his love.\nChoice C is misleading, as it refers to Catherine\u2019s feelings for Linton, not Heathcliff.\nChoice D is incorrect as it highlights his cruelty, not his love for Catherine."}
