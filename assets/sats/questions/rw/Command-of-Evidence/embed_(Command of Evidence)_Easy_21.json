{"introduction": "Excerpt from To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf", "text": "\"In <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, Woolf portrays Mr. Ramsay as a man who grapples with intellectual ambition and the need for personal affirmation. His introspection often leads him to confront his fears about legacy and the fleeting nature of human achievement.\"", "question": "Which quotation from <em>To the Lighthouse</em> most effectively illustrates Mr. Ramsay\u2019s struggle with his intellectual ambitions?", "A": "\u201cHe spoke to his children, his voice calm and steady, without a trace of doubt.\u201d", "B": "\u201cFor a moment, he thought he could see the end of his journey\u2014a glimmer of recognition.\u201d", "C": "\u201cHe moved through the rooms, restless and impatient, seeking something he could not name.\u201d", "D": "\u201cAs he read his book by the fire, he seemed oblivious to the world around him.\u201d", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer, as it captures Mr. Ramsay\u2019s momentary hope for acknowledgment, reflecting his inner conflict about legacy and recognition.\nChoice A is incorrect because it implies general restlessness, not intellectual ambition.\nChoice B is misleading as it shows confidence, contrary to his struggles.\nChoice D is incorrect because it focuses on his isolation, not his ambition or self-doubt."}
