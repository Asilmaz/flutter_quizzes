{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway", "text": "\"Santiago, an aging fisherman, faces a long struggle against a massive marlin. Though he is physically weakened, his determination and pride drive him to continue the battle, refusing to let go even as the odds mount against him.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> best illustrates Santiago\u2019s determination and pride?", "A": "\u201cI will fight them until I die, and I will die with my pride intact.\u201d", "B": "\u201cThe fish was powerful, but Santiago\u2019s resolve was unshaken.\u201d", "C": "\u201cHe watched the vast sea, a reminder of his solitude and age.\u201d", "D": "\u201cHis hands bled, but he tightened his grip, unwilling to surrender.\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is correct, as it directly shows Santiago\u2019s willingness to endure physical pain and his refusal to give up, highlighting both his pride and determination.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it reflects pride but lacks the specific struggle with the fish.\nChoice C is misleading, emphasizing solitude without determination.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it suggests strength but not Santiago\u2019s physical endurance in the struggle."}
