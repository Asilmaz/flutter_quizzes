{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger", "text": "\"Holden Caulfield frequently expresses his disdain for the \u2018phoniness\u2019 he sees around him, finding it difficult to connect with others in a world he views as insincere. His constant criticism of the people he encounters highlights his feelings of isolation and mistrust.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> best illustrates Holden\u2019s feelings about the phoniness of others?", "A": "\u201cI looked around, feeling like I didn\u2019t belong with any of them.\u201d", "B": "\u201cEvery time I tried to say something real, they just ignored it.\u201d", "C": "\u201cIt\u2019s full of phonies, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d", "D": "\u201cThey laughed at things that weren\u2019t even funny, like it was a routine.\u201d", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is correct, as it directly conveys Holden\u2019s strong aversion to what he perceives as the phoniness in the world around him, illustrating his feelings of disconnection.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it suggests detachment but not a focus on phoniness.\nChoice C is misleading, implying routine behavior without Holden\u2019s intense judgment.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it suggests frustration rather than a critique of phoniness."}
