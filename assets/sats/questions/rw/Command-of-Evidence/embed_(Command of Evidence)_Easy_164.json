{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne", "text": "\"Hester Prynne endures public shame for her sin, yet she grows stronger in her isolation. Her resilience transforms the scarlet letter from a mark of shame into a symbol of her strength and independence.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> best illustrates Hester\u2019s resilience?", "A": "\u201cShe had wandered, without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness.\u201d", "B": "\u201cHer spirit rose above the shame, a quiet strength radiating from within.\u201d", "C": "\u201cThe townspeople stared, yet she lowered her head in silence.\u201d", "D": "\u201cA light flickered in her eyes, but it vanished just as quickly.\u201d", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice B is correct, as it directly conveys Hester\u2019s strength in overcoming shame and her resilience in the face of isolation.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it suggests confusion rather than strength.\nChoice C is misleading, as it implies submission rather than resilience.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it indicates a fleeting moment rather than enduring resilience."}
