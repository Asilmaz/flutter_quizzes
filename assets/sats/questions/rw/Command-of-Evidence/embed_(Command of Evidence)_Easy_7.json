{"introduction": "Excerpt from Dinosaurs of North America by John H. Ostrom", "text": "\"In a study of fossilized tracks, paleontologists examined the footprints of two different dinosaur species from the Cretaceous period. By analyzing footprint size, stride length, and track patterns, they inferred differences in speed and movement between the species. Findings suggest that one species, with longer strides, was capable of ______.\"", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses data to complete the statement?", "A": "slower movement over longer distances.", "B": "quicker, agile maneuvers in rocky areas.", "C": "moving faster due to its larger, deeper footprints.", "D": "moving faster due to its longer stride length.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because longer stride length typically indicates a greater capacity for speed, supporting the inference about the dinosaur's movement.\nChoice A is incorrect because longer strides generally suggest faster, not slower, movement.\nChoice B is misleading; agility isn\u2019t directly related to stride length.\nChoice C is incorrect because footprint depth does not directly indicate speed but rather weight or ground softness."}
