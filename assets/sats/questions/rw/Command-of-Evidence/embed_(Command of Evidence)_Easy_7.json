	"introduction": "Passage from 'Zoological Surveys in the Boreal Zone' (2023)",
	"text": "Field biologists studying a newly identified fox population observed its unique behavior of storing surplus food in the hollows of trees—a habit not commonly seen among other fox species in the region. Genetic analysis suggests these foxes split off from a larger population to the south roughly two centuries ago, adapting to colder climates by altering hunting patterns and developing thicker winter coats. However, the tree-storage habit is not easily explained by environmental factors alone, prompting researchers to hypothesize learned behavior passed through generations.",
	"question": "Why is the tree-storage habit considered puzzling to the researchers?",
	"A": "It does not align with the foxes’ thicker coat adaptations for cold weather",
	"B": "It was never documented by historical observers of southern fox populations",
	"C": "It cannot be explained solely by local climate conditions",
	"D": "It appears only in artificially sustained environments",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the text explicitly states that environmental factors alone do not explain the foxes’ unique storage behavior, suggesting learned cultural transmission."
