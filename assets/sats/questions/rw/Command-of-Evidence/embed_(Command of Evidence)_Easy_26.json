{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Solar System and Its Dwarf Planets by Jane Holloway", "text": "\"Like the major planets, some dwarf planets have moons, although the number varies. While some dwarf planets possess no moons, others have exactly one, and a few have multiple moons orbiting them, providing insights into their formation and structure.\"", "question": "Based on the table, which two dwarf planets have exactly one moon?", "A": "Pluto and Haumea", "B": "Makemake and Eris", "C": "Ceres and Haumea", "D": "Pluto and Ceres", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because both Makemake and Eris have exactly one moon, as indicated in the table, aligning with the details in the excerpt.\nChoice A is incorrect because Haumea has more than one moon.\nChoice C is misleading as Ceres has no moons.\nChoice D is incorrect since Pluto has multiple moons, not just one."}
