	"introduction": "Excerpt from 'Advancements in Marine Robotics' (2023)",
	"text": "Recent prototypes of autonomous underwater drones have demonstrated enhanced stability in strong currents by using a flexible-fin system modeled after certain fish. While the designs excel at navigating coral reefs, some engineers are concerned about increased power consumption. The project’s data reveal that the flexible fins function best when sensor readings proactively adjust their angles, a process requiring continuous computational input. Nonetheless, the drones’ agility in complex terrain could revolutionize deep-sea research.",
	"question": "What drawback do engineers identify regarding the flexible-fin underwater drones?",
	"A": "They operate only at shallow depths and cannot venture into deep waters",
	"B": "They rely heavily on extra power due to real-time angle adjustments",
	"C": "They mimic fish movements incompletely, leading to unstable motion",
	"D": "They are ineffective in coral reef environments under moderate current",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the text states that continuous computational input to adjust fin angles increases power consumption, representing a concern for the engineers."
