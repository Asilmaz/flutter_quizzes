{"introduction": "Excerpt from Tropical Climates of Central America by Linda S. Green", "text": "\"Central America experiences varied rainfall patterns, with some regions seeing significantly higher rainfall during certain months. In June, for example, the rainfall in coastal areas tends to be heavier than in inland areas, leading to contrasting climate conditions that influence local agriculture and water resources.\"", "question": "Which choice most effectively uses data about rainfall patterns in Central America to complete the statement?", "A": "Both inland and coastal areas experience nearly equal rainfall levels in June.", "B": "Coastal areas have consistently high rainfall year-round, unlike inland areas.", "C": "Rainfall in coastal areas is generally heavier in June compared to inland areas.", "D": "Inland areas typically receive more rainfall than coastal areas in June.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately reflects the excerpt\u2019s statement about heavier rainfall in coastal areas compared to inland areas during June.\nChoice A is incorrect because it contradicts the statement that coastal areas receive more rainfall in June.\nChoice B is misleading, as it suggests high rainfall year-round, which isn\u2019t stated.\nChoice D is incorrect because it implies similar rainfall levels, contrary to the excerpt."}
