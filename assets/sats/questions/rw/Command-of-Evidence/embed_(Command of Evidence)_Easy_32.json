{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Habits of Arctic Animals by Dr. Helen Parker", "text": "\"During the Arctic winter, animals such as polar bears and arctic foxes have adapted behaviors to conserve energy and withstand extreme temperatures. For example, some species alter their hunting patterns and move to areas with more consistent food sources.\"", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support Dr. Parker\u2019s claim about these animals' adaptive behaviors?", "A": "Polar bears increase their hunting activity in summer months.", "B": "Arctic foxes dig deeper dens for warmth during colder months.", "C": "Polar bears and arctic foxes migrate south during harsh winters.", "D": "Arctic foxes rely less on hunting and more on scavenging in winter.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice D is correct because it illustrates an adaptive behavior (relying more on scavenging) that supports the claim about energy conservation during winter.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it describes summer behavior rather than winter adaptation.\nChoice B is misleading, focusing on physical changes rather than hunting adjustments.\nChoice C is incorrect, as neither species typically migrates far south."}
