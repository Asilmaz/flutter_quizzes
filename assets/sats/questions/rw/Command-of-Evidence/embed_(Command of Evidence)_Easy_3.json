	"text": "Dr. Santos’s theory posits that the human mind can be simulated in computational structures, but it also holds that true consciousness arises only when these simulations interact dynamically with physical environments. According to Santos, a purely virtual intelligence—one lacking a sensorimotor interface—can process data but cannot achieve what we would classify as conscious awareness. Critics argue this viewpoint underestimates the complexity of purely digital cognition, but Santos counters that embodiment is crucial to subjective experience.",
	"question": "What aspect of consciousness does Dr. Santos’s theory emphasize as essential?",
	"A": "Software complexity capable of self-replication",
	"B": "Direct environmental interaction via physical embodiment",
	"C": "Access to expansive networks of information",
	"D": "Innate linguistic abilities within the computational model",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Dr. Santos explicitly states that a sensorimotor interface (physical embodiment) is required for genuine consciousness. The other choices are not presented as fundamental by Santos."
