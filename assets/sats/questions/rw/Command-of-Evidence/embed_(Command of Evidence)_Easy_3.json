{"introduction": "Book Excerpt: Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman", "text": "\"In one of his poems, Whitman explores the theme of individualism, suggesting that each person is vast and complex, containing multitudes that are often misunderstood. He expresses frustration that people rarely embrace their full identities and, instead, remain confined to narrow views of themselves.\"", "question": "Which quotation from <em>Leaves of Grass</em> most effectively illustrates the claim?", "A": "\u201cThe spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.\u201d", "B": "\u201cI am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d", "C": "\u201cYou shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me.\u201d", "D": "\u201cI have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end.\u201d", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it directly supports the theme of individual complexity and the idea that each person holds many facets within themselves, as mentioned in the excerpt.\nChoice B is incorrect because it refers to listening to others, not an understanding of the self.\nChoice C is misleading because it suggests independence but doesn\u2019t address personal complexity.\nChoice D is incorrect because it involves an external perspective rather than Whitman\u2019s view on individualism."}
