	"introduction": "Passage from 'Musical Innovation in 20th-Century Compositions' (2025)",
	"text": "Komatsu’s early symphonies, written in the 1920s, employed folk melodies interwoven with modernist dissonances, shocking audiences accustomed to traditional tonality. Critics at the time were divided, with some praising the bold innovation and others lamenting the jarring effect. Today, musicologists view these pieces as precursors to mid-century experimental works, noting that Komatsu paved the way for later composers to blend vernacular tunes with atonal progressions in mainstream performances.",
	"question": "Which aspect of Komatsu’s symphonies was most surprising to contemporary audiences?",
	"A": "The exclusive use of folk instruments throughout the entire symphony",
	"B": "The fusion of regional folk melodies with harsh, dissonant modern elements",
	"C": "The reliance on strictly atonal frameworks devoid of recognizable themes",
	"D": "The unusual brevity of each movement compared to traditional symphonies",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the passage indicates the combination of folk melodies with modernist dissonances was unexpected and divisive among audiences used to tonal music. The other options are not explicitly stated."
