{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Psychology of Fear and Enjoyment by Dr. Emily Langford", "text": "\"Research has shown that controlled exposure to fear, such as through haunted houses or scary movies, can sometimes enhance individuals\u2019 moods. After experiencing fear in a safe environment, many people report feelings of excitement and satisfaction.\"", "question": "Which quotation from a participant would best illustrate Dr. Langford\u2019s findings?", "A": "\u201cAfter going through the haunted house, I felt an unexpected sense of accomplishment.\u201d", "B": "\u201cI spent most of my time laughing with friends, and it wasn\u2019t frightening at all.\u201d", "C": "\u201cThe haunted house wasn\u2019t as scary as I expected, so I felt calm afterward.\u201d", "D": "\u201cI felt nervous the entire time, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do it again.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer, as it reflects the enhanced mood and satisfaction described, supporting Dr. Langford\u2019s findings on positive effects after a controlled fear experience.\nChoice A is incorrect as it lacks any positive response.\nChoice C is misleading since it doesn\u2019t show an increase in mood or excitement.\nChoice D is incorrect as it describes a lack of fear, not a positive mood boost following fear."}
