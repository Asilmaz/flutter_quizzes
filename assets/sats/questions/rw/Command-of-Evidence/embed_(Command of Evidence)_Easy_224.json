{"introduction": "Excerpt from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "text": "\"Throughout her life, Jane Eyre demonstrates a fierce independence and commitment to self-respect, even in the face of great hardship. Her love for Mr. Rochester is deep, but she refuses to compromise her principles, no matter how strong her feelings are.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>Jane Eyre</em> best illustrates Jane\u2019s commitment to her principles?", "A": "\u201cHe was all I had ever wanted, but my conscience would not rest.\u201d", "B": "\u201cHer heart ached, yet her resolve did not waver.\u201d", "C": "\u201cThe manor\u2019s grandeur left her in awe, but she felt a sense of foreboding.\u201d", "D": "\u201cI am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is correct, as it directly reflects Jane\u2019s fierce independence and her refusal to be constrained, showcasing her strong principles.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it hints at emotional conflict but lacks the emphasis on independence.\nChoice C is misleading, suggesting inner conflict without commitment to principles.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it describes her reaction to the setting, not her principles."}
