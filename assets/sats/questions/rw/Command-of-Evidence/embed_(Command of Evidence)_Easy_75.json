{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger", "text": "\"Holden Caulfield frequently criticizes the \u2018phoniness\u2019 he sees in the adult world, struggling to find authenticity in his interactions. His disdain for insincerity isolates him, leaving him feeling disconnected from those around him.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> best illustrates Holden\u2019s feelings about \u201cphoniness\u201d?", "A": "\u201cIt\u2019s full of phonies, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d", "B": "\u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t belong anywhere, like I was on the outside looking in.\u201d", "C": "\u201cI kept picturing old Spencer, but I didn\u2019t want to think about him.\u201d", "D": "\u201cPeople are always ruining things for you.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is correct, as it directly conveys Holden\u2019s view of the world as \u201cfull of phonies,\u201d reflecting his distaste for insincerity.\nChoice B is incorrect, as it suggests isolation rather than his view on phoniness.\nChoice C is misleading, showing avoidance but not disdain for phoniness.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it reflects frustration without specifically addressing insincerity."}
