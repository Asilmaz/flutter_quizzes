	"text": "Archaeologists recently uncovered a shipment of pottery fragments from a coastal site believed to be part of a major trade nexus. Chemical analyses showed clay sources nearly 500 kilometers inland, suggesting that traders transported these goods through extensive routes. Intriguingly, the style of decoration on the pottery was reminiscent of local motifs from the coastal zone, suggesting that artisans adapted foreign materials to native artistic traditions. The find sheds light on how distant trade partners influenced each otherâ€™s craft forms, potentially merging techniques over long periods.",
	"question": "Which evidence best illustrates that the pottery was a product of cross-regional collaboration?",
	"A": "Clay from inland areas was formed into vessels featuring coastal decorative motifs",
	"B": "Shipping ledgers indicated the presence of multiple sponsors financing the expedition",
	"C": "Archaeologists found kilns near the coast used only for regional pottery production",
	"D": "Pottery styles remained unchanged despite exposure to outside influences",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because it shows inland materials combined with coastal artistic designs, indicating a blend of two distinct regional influences. Other options do not clearly demonstrate cross-regional collaboration in the production process."
