{"introduction": "Excerpt from Green Innovations in Food Production by Amanda Clark", "text": "\"Researchers experimenting with hydroponic farming\u2014growing plants without soil\u2014found that using LED lights could effectively replace natural sunlight. Initial tests with low-intensity LEDs were promising, but researchers hypothesized that higher-intensity LEDs could speed up plant growth and yield larger harvests.\"", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?", "A": "Plants grown with medium-intensity LEDs showed no growth rate difference compared to natural sunlight.", "B": "Plants grown with LED lights required more frequent watering than those grown with natural sunlight.", "C": "Plants grown with higher-intensity LEDs reached maturity faster than those with lower-intensity LEDs.", "D": "Plants grown in soil and natural sunlight had slightly higher nutrient levels than those grown hydroponically.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer as it shows that higher-intensity LEDs led to faster plant maturity, directly supporting the hypothesis about increased growth speed and yield.\nChoice A is incorrect as it suggests no difference in growth rate.\nChoice C is misleading because watering needs are unrelated to LED intensity\u2019s effect on growth.\nChoice D is incorrect because it compares nutrient levels rather than growth speed or yield."}
