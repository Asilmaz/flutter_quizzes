	"introduction": "Passage from 'Literary Cross-Pollination in Early Modern Europe' (2024)",
	"text": "Travel diaries from diplomats stationed abroad show that local literary circles often adapted foreign styles, while preserving distinctly regional narratives. These diaries describe gatherings where translated poems, recited in local tongues, spurred new hybrid genres. The phenomenon is believed to have laid groundwork for modern comparative literature, as these early poets would incorporate foreign rhyme schemes, yet root their content in homegrown folklore. Some critics argue these blends obscured national identity, while others see them as fruitful cross-cultural innovations.",
	"question": "Which practice most clearly exemplifies the blending of literary traditions noted in the passage?",
	"A": "Using solely local language and ignoring foreign forms",
	"B": "Reading foreign poems in their original language without adaptation",
	"C": "Translating foreign verse styles into local dialect while retaining native themes",
	"D": "Mandating strict censorship of foreign works to preserve cultural purity",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the diaries describe a hybrid process of adopting foreign styles (rhyme schemes) but aligning them with the regionâ€™s own folkloric content, demonstrating cross-pollination of literary traditions."
