{"introduction": "Excerpt from Dancing Across Borders by Cynthia Novak", "text": "\"Renowned choreographer Maria Ramos spent years studying traditional dances in Southeast Asia. Her work, particularly her dance piece <em>Echoes of the East</em>, reflects her desire to integrate cultural elements she observed into a modern framework.\"", "question": "Which quotation from a dance critic would best support the claim about Ramos\u2019s approach in <em>Echoes of the East</em>?", "A": "\u201cIn <em>Echoes of the East</em>, Ramos incorporates rhythmic movements inspired by traditional Asian ceremonies.\u201d", "B": "\u201cRamos\u2019s performances are known for their athleticism and abstract choreography.\u201d", "C": "\u201cRamos\u2019s work is characterized by minimalist sets and modern costumes, appealing to contemporary audiences.\u201d", "D": "\u201c<em>Echoes of the East</em> focuses on individual expression rather than collective or traditional forms.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it supports the claim that Ramos integrated traditional Southeast Asian elements into her work, aligning with her intent to reflect cultural aspects.\nChoice A is incorrect as it speaks generally of her style, not cultural integration.\nChoice C is misleading, focusing on visuals rather than cultural themes.\nChoice D is incorrect because it emphasizes individualism, which contrasts with the traditional focus in her work."}
