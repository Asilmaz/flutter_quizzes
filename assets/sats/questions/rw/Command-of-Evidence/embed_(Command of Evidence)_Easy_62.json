{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain", "text": "\"Huck Finn wrestles with his conscience as he decides whether to help Jim, a runaway slave, attain freedom. Despite the values instilled in him by society, Huck\u2019s friendship with Jim grows, making him question the morality of the world around him.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> best illustrates Huck\u2019s moral conflict?", "A": "\u201cI felt uneasy and ashamed, like I had done something wrong.\u201d", "B": "\u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll go to hell.\u201d", "C": "\u201cI couldn\u2019t ever seem to strike the right way to help him.\u201d", "D": "\u201cPeople said it was wrong, but I couldn\u2019t see how.\u201d", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice B is correct because it directly conveys Huck\u2019s decision to help Jim, even if he believes it may condemn him, showing his struggle with moral beliefs.\nChoice A is incorrect as it implies indecision rather than conflict.\nChoice C is misleading, as it suggests guilt without clear resolution.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it reflects uncertainty but not the depth of Huck\u2019s moral conflict."}
