{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Social Life of Dolphins by Amy Samuels", "text": "\"Recent research has revealed that dolphins exhibit complex social behaviors, often forming long-term bonds and cooperating in ways that suggest a level of social intelligence. For example, researchers have observed that dolphins sometimes work together to protect younger dolphins from potential threats.\"", "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support Samuels's claim about dolphin cooperation?", "A": "Male dolphins often collaborate to help raise the offspring of other dolphins.", "B": "Some dolphin species have been observed living in larger groups than others.", "C": "Dolphins frequently swim alongside boats, entertaining tourists.", "D": "Dolphins use a series of clicks and whistles to communicate over long distances.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it directly illustrates cooperative behavior, as male dolphins help raise offspring that aren\u2019t their own, supporting the claim of social intelligence and cooperation.\nChoice A is incorrect as it describes behavior around humans, not social cooperation.\nChoice B is misleading, as it focuses on group size rather than cooperative behavior.\nChoice D is incorrect; while it describes communication, it does not illustrate cooperation."}
