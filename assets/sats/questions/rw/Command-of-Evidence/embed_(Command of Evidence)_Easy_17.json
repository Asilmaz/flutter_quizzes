	"introduction": "Passage from 'Reform Movements in Early 19th-Century Societies' (2025)",
	"text": "Following a wave of industrial growth, many urban centers faced overcrowding and poor sanitation. Groups of civic reformers emerged, pushing legislation that mandated street cleaning schedules and improved building standards. While some historians see these measures as primarily economic necessities—designed to maintain a healthy workforce—others interpret them as moral imperatives, reflecting society’s growing concern for public welfare and dignity. Evidence of thorough inspections and fines for noncompliance points to a heightened sense of accountability among city officials.",
	"question": "Which evidence would most strongly support the interpretation that reform measures were driven by moral imperatives?",
	"A": "Records showing that public officials financed new sanitation programs using city taxes",
	"B": "Correspondences in which reformers cite ethical duties to protect citizens’ well-being",
	"C": "Engineering documents detailing the efficient design of modern sewage infrastructure",
	"D": "Statistical data correlating decreased worker absenteeism with improved sanitation",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because direct references to moral or ethical obligations in primary-source letters or discussions best support the idea that moral imperatives fueled the reforms, rather than purely economic concerns."
