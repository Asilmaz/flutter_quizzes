{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Awakening by Kate Chopin", "text": "\"Edna Pontellier begins to question her roles as a wife and mother, feeling confined by the expectations placed on her by society. Her longing for independence leads her to pursue her own desires, challenging the norms of her time.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Awakening</em> best illustrates Edna\u2019s desire for independence?", "A": "\u201cShe felt a deep restlessness, an urge to break free from her daily routine.\u201d", "B": "\u201cHer husband\u2019s expectations weighed heavily, yet she followed them without question.\u201d", "C": "\u201cThe children seemed to demand all her attention, yet she was content.\u201d", "D": "\u201cI would give up the unessential; I would give my money, I would give my life.\u201d", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice B is correct, as it directly reflects Edna\u2019s restlessness and her yearning for freedom from societal constraints.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it shows her willingness to sacrifice but doesn\u2019t focus on independence.\nChoice C is misleading, as it suggests conformity rather than questioning.\nChoice D is incorrect, as it implies contentment rather than a desire for independence."}
