{"introduction": "Excerpt from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain", "text": "\"Huck wrestles with his conscience as he decides whether to help Jim, a runaway slave, gain his freedom. Despite society\u2019s rules, Huck\u2019s growing bond with Jim makes him question whether the laws he\u2019s been taught are just.\"", "question": "Which line from <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> best illustrates Huck\u2019s internal struggle?", "A": "\u201cI made up my mind to leave him there until I had a chance to talk it over with Jim.\u201d", "B": "\u201cIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger.\u201d", "C": "\u201cI told him I wouldn\u2019t ever tell, and I didn\u2019t.\u201d", "D": "\u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll go to hell \u2014 and tore it up.\u201d", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice C is correct, as Huck\u2019s willingness to \u201cgo to hell\u201d for Jim reflects his deep internal conflict over helping him despite societal norms.\nChoice A is incorrect, as it does not address his moral struggle.\nChoice B is misleading, reflecting hesitation but not his moral decision.\nChoice D is incorrect as it relates to a promise rather than internal conflict."}
