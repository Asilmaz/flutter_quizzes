{"introduction": "Excerpt from Urban Cycling Trends by Fiona Thompson", "text": "\"In a study on urban cycling, researchers found that experienced cyclists who primarily commute to work prefer routes that offer designated bike lanes and minimize contact with car traffic. This preference was most prominent among cyclists who traveled more than five miles each day.\"", "question": "Which survey response from an urban cyclist would best support the researchers\u2019 findings?", "A": "\u201cI bike short distances in the city, often taking whichever roads are the quickest.\u201d", "B": "\u201cI usually avoid main roads and prefer bike paths, especially during my commute to work.\u201d", "C": "\u201cI sometimes bike to work but prefer scenic routes, even if they\u2019re close to traffic.\u201d", "D": "\u201cI only bike on weekends for leisure, so I don\u2019t mind riding near car traffic.\u201d", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer as it aligns with the researchers\u2019 findings that experienced, commuting cyclists prefer routes with bike lanes, especially when commuting to work.\nChoice B is incorrect because it focuses on weekend leisure, not daily commuting.\nChoice C is misleading, as it suggests quick routes over safe, designated lanes.\nChoice D is incorrect because it emphasizes scenic routes near traffic rather than safety and efficiency."}
