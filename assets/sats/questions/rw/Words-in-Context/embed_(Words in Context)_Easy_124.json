{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw's emotions after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly observed Catherine from a distance as she sat by the fire, her face reflecting the conflict within her. Catherine had always been a passionate woman, but since her marriage to Edgar, she seemed more withdrawn and restless. Despite her outward appearance of happiness, Nelly could sense that Catherine\u2019s heart was still tied to Heathcliff. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s unresolved love for Heathcliff seemed to __________ her, preventing her from fully embracing the life she had chosen with Edgar.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "empower", "B": "liberate", "C": "define", "D": "consume", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Consume\nChoice A, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings for Heathcliff are taking over her emotional state, leading to inner turmoil. The passage suggests that her love for Heathcliff is overwhelming her and preventing her from being at peace in her marriage.\nB is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply that Catherine's feelings are setting her free, but the passage shows that her love for Heathcliff is creating conflict, not freedom.\nC is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that her feelings are shaping her identity or giving her clarity, but instead, they seem to be a source of confusion and emotional struggle.\nD is incorrect because \"empower\" would suggest that her feelings are making her stronger or more capable, but the passage highlights her distress, not empowerment."}
