{"introduction": "The following text is from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. Holden Caulfield reflects on his sense of alienation from the world around him.", "text": "Holden sat in the corner of the caf\u00e9, staring blankly at his coffee. He had always felt like an outsider, someone who didn\u2019t quite fit in with the people around him. It wasn\u2019t that he disliked people\u2014he just didn\u2019t understand them. They seemed so superficial and preoccupied with things that didn\u2019t matter to him. Holden couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of __________, as though he were watching life unfold from a distance, never able to fully participate or connect with others.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "disillusionment", "B": "confusion", "C": "contentment", "D": "detachment", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Detachment\nChoice D, \"detachment,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects Holden\u2019s emotional distance from others. The passage describes how he observes life without truly participating in it, which fits with the idea of detachment\u2014a state of being disconnected or emotionally distant.\nA is incorrect because \"disillusionment\" suggests a loss of belief or a sense of disappointment, but the passage focuses more on Holden\u2019s emotional isolation rather than a shift in belief.\nB is incorrect because \"confusion\" implies a lack of understanding, but Holden isn\u2019t confused\u2014he simply feels disconnected from others.\nC is incorrect because \"contentment\" suggests a sense of satisfaction and peace, which contradicts the sense of isolation and emotional distance Holden is experiencing."}
