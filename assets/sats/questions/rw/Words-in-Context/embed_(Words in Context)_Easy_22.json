As he looked back at the path that had led him to this point, he realized that his ambition had ________ the dangers of his experiment, blinding him to the consequences of playing God.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "amplified", "B": "justified", "C": "ignored", "D": "minimized", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Ignored\nChoice A, \"ignored,\" is the best answer because it fits the context of Victor\u2019s realization that he was so focused on his ambition that he failed to consider the dangers of his actions. The text suggests that Victor was blind to the risks of his experiment, meaning he ignored them.\nB is incorrect because \"justified\" would imply that Victor defended or rationalized the dangers, which is not the case. Instead, he overlooked them entirely.\nC is incorrect because \"amplified\" would mean he increased the dangers, but the passage focuses on him not paying attention to them at all.\nD is incorrect because \"minimized\" suggests that Victor downplayed the dangers, which is not as accurate as him completely ignoring them."}
