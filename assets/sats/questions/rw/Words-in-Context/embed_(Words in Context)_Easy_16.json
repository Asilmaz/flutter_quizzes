{"introduction": "The following text is from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Raskolnikov reflects on his troubled conscience after committing a crime.", "text": "Raskolnikov sat in his small, dimly lit room, his hands trembling as he thought about the crime he had committed. The weight of his actions was suffocating, and no matter how hard he tried to suppress it, the guilt gnawed at him like a relentless force. He had believed that he could justify his actions through some abstract, intellectual reasoning, but now he saw how impossible it was to ignore the consequences. He began to realize that his actions were not just morally wrong but also ________, as they had led him down a path of self-destruction and despair.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "insignificant", "B": "inevitable", "C": "irreversible", "D": "commendable", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Irreversible\nChoice C, \"irreversible,\" is the best answer because it logically reflects Raskolnikov\u2019s realization that the consequences of his crime cannot be undone. The passage describes how he feels trapped by his actions, unable to escape the guilt and despair that follow.\nA is incorrect because \"insignificant\" would suggest that the crime had no major consequences, which contradicts the passage\u2019s emphasis on the deep, suffocating guilt and regret Raskolnikov feels.\nB is incorrect because \"inevitable\" implies that something was bound to happen, but Raskolnikov is realizing that his actions were not just a result of external factors but driven by his own choices.\nD is incorrect because \"commendable\" would suggest that Raskolnikov\u2019s actions were worthy of praise, which directly contradicts the guilt and despair he is experiencing."}
