	"introduction": "The following text is from a scientific journal describing an experiment on the flight patterns of migratory birds.",
	"text": "Researchers were surprised to discover that, under certain weather conditions, the birds took a route that was more __________ than their usual direct path, suggesting adaptation rather than error.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "tortuous",
	"B": "trivial",
	"C": "apropos",
	"D": "stagnant",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A, \"tortuous,\" implies a winding or indirect path, which fits the idea of a route thatâ€™s not straightforward. \"Trivial\" suggests insignificance, \"apropos\" means appropriate, and \"stagnant\" implies lack of movement, none of which describes an indirect route."
