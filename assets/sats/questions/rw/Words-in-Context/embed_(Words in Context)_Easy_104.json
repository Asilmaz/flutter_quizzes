The passage indicates that Jane\u2019s emotions are becoming more layered and conflicted, rather than straightforward.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that her feelings are becoming easier to understand, but the passage shows that her emotions are growing more complex.\nC is incorrect because \"simplify\" would imply that Jane\u2019s feelings are becoming clearer or less complicated, which is the opposite of what is happening in the passage.\nD is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that her feelings for Mr. Rochester are becoming stronger, but the passage focuses on the complexity of her emotions rather than simply increasing intensity."}
