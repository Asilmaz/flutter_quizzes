{"introduction": "The following text is from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Victor Frankenstein is reflecting on his ambition and the consequences of his scientific pursuits.", "text": "Victor paced back and forth in his laboratory, the early morning light casting long shadows across the room. His mind was consumed with the creation of life, a project that had overtaken him completely. Though he had once been driven by the noble desire to benefit humanity, he now felt a creeping sense of dread as he gazed upon his creation. His earlier enthusiasm had been replaced by a profound sense of __________ as he realized the magnitude of what he had done. It was not the triumph he had envisioned, but a terrible burden he now had to bear.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "pride", "B": "wonder", "C": "satisfaction", "D": "remorse", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Remorse\nChoice B, \"remorse,\" is the best answer because it reflects Victor\u2019s regret and guilt over his creation. The passage suggests that his initial enthusiasm has been replaced by dread, indicating that he now feels remorse for the consequences of his actions.\nA is incorrect because \"pride\" implies a feeling of self-satisfaction, which contradicts the text\u2019s suggestion that Victor feels burdened by the weight of his creation.\nC is incorrect because \"satisfaction\" would imply that Victor feels content with his achievement, which is not the case. The text emphasizes his negative emotions.\nD is incorrect because \"wonder\" would suggest amazement or awe, which does not align with the dread and anxiety that Victor is now experiencing."}
