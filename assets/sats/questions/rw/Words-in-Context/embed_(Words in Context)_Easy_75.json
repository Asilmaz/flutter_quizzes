{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on the relationship between Daisy Buchanan and Tom Buchanan.", "text": "Nick sat in the drawing room, observing the tension between Daisy and Tom. He had seen them together many times before, but today there was something different in the air. Daisy, who had always been a picture of grace and beauty, seemed restless, her smile forced. Tom, on the other hand, was brash and domineering, his behavior more controlling than ever. Nick realized that the relationship between Daisy and Tom was one of both __________ and dependence, where love was tangled with power and resentment, making it impossible for either of them to break free from the other.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "affection", "B": "indifference", "C": "conflict", "D": "admiration", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Conflict\nChoice C, \"conflict,\" is the best answer because it reflects the underlying tension between Daisy and Tom. Their relationship is described as one where love and power are intertwined with negative emotions like resentment, which creates a constant internal struggle.\nA is incorrect because \"affection\" implies positive feelings, but the passage highlights a more complex, often antagonistic relationship.\nB is incorrect because \"indifference\" would suggest a lack of feeling, but the passage conveys that their relationship is full of strong emotions, even if they are negative.\nD is incorrect because \"admiration\" would imply respect and positive regard, which doesn\u2019t match the tense, power-laden dynamic described in the passage."}
