{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on his experiences with Jay Gatsby.", "text": "Nick stood by the window, watching the guests spill out into the garden at Gatsby\u2019s mansion. The party was in full swing, with laughter and music filling the air. Yet, despite the extravagance, Nick couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was missing. Everyone seemed to be there for the spectacle, but no one really seemed to know Gatsby or care about him. As Nick observed, he realized that Gatsby\u2019s success and wealth had begun to __________ him, making it impossible for anyone to see the man behind the persona.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "hinder", "B": "elevate", "C": "empower", "D": "isolate", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Isolate\nChoice A, \"isolate,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Gatsby\u2019s wealth and social status have created a barrier between him and others. The passage suggests that his public image prevents people from truly understanding or connecting with him as a person.\nB is incorrect because \"elevate\" would imply that his success lifts him in a positive way, but the passage conveys that it distances him emotionally from those around him.\nC is incorrect because \"empower\" would suggest that Gatsby\u2019s wealth enables him to form deeper connections, which is not the case. His wealth has led to his isolation.\nD is incorrect because \"hinder\" would suggest that Gatsby\u2019s wealth stops him from achieving something, but it\u2019s more about the emotional distance it creates between him and others, rather than hindering his success."}
