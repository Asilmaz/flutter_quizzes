{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s turbulent emotions after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly watched Catherine as she walked through the garden, her thoughts clouded with conflicting emotions. Catherine had married Edgar Linton, but it was clear to Nelly that her heart still belonged to Heathcliff. The two men seemed to represent different aspects of Catherine\u2019s desires\u2014Edgar offering comfort and status, while Heathcliff represented passion and freedom. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff had begun to __________ her, creating a constant inner struggle that prevented her from truly being happy with Edgar.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "define", "B": "torment", "C": "soothe", "D": "clarify", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Torment\nChoice C, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s conflicting feelings for Heathcliff and Edgar create inner turmoil. The passage suggests that her unresolved love for Heathcliff is causing emotional pain and distress, preventing her from finding peace.\nA is incorrect because \"define\" would suggest that Heathcliff\u2019s feelings are helping Catherine gain clarity, but the passage shows that they are causing emotional conflict.\nB is incorrect because \"soothe\" implies that Heathcliff\u2019s influence is calming Catherine, which contradicts the idea of her struggle and unhappiness.\nD is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that her feelings for Heathcliff are helping her make sense of her emotions, but the passage suggests that they are only complicating and tormenting her."}
