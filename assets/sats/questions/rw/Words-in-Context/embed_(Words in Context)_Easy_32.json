{"introduction": "The following text is from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Victor Frankenstein reflects on the consequences of creating his monster.", "text": "Victor sat alone in his study, his hands trembling as he thought about the creature he had brought to life. He had once been filled with excitement and ambition, but now all he felt was fear and guilt. The monster\u2019s grotesque appearance haunted his thoughts, and he could not escape the reality of what he had done. As he pondered the monster\u2019s fate, Victor realized that his attempt to create life had only __________ the misery of those around him, including himself. The horror of his actions had now become something far beyond his control.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "relieved", "B": "justified", "C": "intensified", "D": "concealed", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Intensified\nChoice B, \"intensified,\" is the best answer because it logically fits the context of Victor's growing sense of horror and guilt. His creation has not only caused misery but has escalated the suffering of everyone involved, including himself. \"Intensified\" conveys how the consequences of his actions have grown worse.\nA is incorrect because \"relieved\" suggests that the situation has been eased or made better, which contradicts the passage's focus on increased misery and fear.\nC is incorrect because \"justified\" would imply that Victor believes his actions are reasonable, but the passage suggests he feels immense guilt, not justification.\nD is incorrect because \"concealed\" implies hiding or covering something up, but the passage emphasizes the increasing and unavoidable reality of the misery Victor faces."}
