{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her changing view of Mr. Darcy after receiving his letter.", "text": "Elizabeth sat by the window, holding Mr. Darcy's letter in her hands. She had read it multiple times, each time feeling a little more convinced that her initial judgment of him had been hasty. His words, though unexpected, revealed a side of him that Elizabeth had never seen before. She realized that her past opinion of him had been shaped by her own prejudices, and she now saw that he was not the arrogant man she once believed. Elizabeth\u2019s perception of Mr. Darcy had begun to __________, changing from disdain to a more balanced view.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "clarify", "B": "intensify", "C": "distort", "D": "soften", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Soften\nChoice C, \"soften,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Elizabeth's feelings toward Mr. Darcy have become less harsh and more understanding. The passage indicates a shift from initial negative judgment to a more thoughtful and nuanced view.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s feelings are becoming clearer in a positive way, but the passage suggests a change in tone, not clarity.\nB is incorrect because \"intensify\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s feelings for Darcy are growing stronger in a negative way, which contradicts the passage where her feelings are evolving into a more balanced understanding.\nD is incorrect because \"distort\" would suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s view is becoming more warped, which is the opposite of the more reasonable perspective she is developing."}
