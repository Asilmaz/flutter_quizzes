{"introduction": "The following text is from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hester Prynne reflects on the effects of her public punishment.", "text": "Hester stood before the crowd, the weight of the scarlet letter heavy on her chest. The people who once respected her now viewed her with judgment and scorn. Yet, as she looked out at the crowd, Hester felt a strange sense of defiance growing within her. Over the years, the letter had ceased to symbolize only shame. Instead, it had come to __________ her, marking not just her sin but her strength and resilience in the face of constant condemnation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "overshadow", "B": "empower", "C": "conceal", "D": "distort", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Empower\nChoice C, \"empower,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Hester\u2019s experience with the scarlet letter has transformed it from a symbol of shame into a mark of strength. Over time, she has taken control of the letter\u2019s meaning, using it to symbolize her resilience rather than her disgrace.\nA is incorrect because \"overshadow\" would suggest that the letter hides or diminishes Hester\u2019s true nature, but the passage indicates that she has reclaimed it as a source of strength.\nB is incorrect because \"conceal\" would suggest that the letter hides something, but Hester\u2019s defiance and growth in character are evident, not concealed.\nD is incorrect because \"distort\" implies that the letter changes or corrupts Hester\u2019s meaning in a negative way, which doesn\u2019t align with the idea of it becoming a symbol of empowerment."}
