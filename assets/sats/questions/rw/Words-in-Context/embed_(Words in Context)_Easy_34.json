{"introduction": "The following text is from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray reflects on the changes in his character after years of indulgence.", "text": "Dorian stood before his portrait, watching the subtle changes in the painted image. His face remained as youthful and beautiful as the day the portrait was created, but his actions\u2014his lifestyle\u2014had left marks on his soul. He had pursued pleasure without thought, indulging in every desire, but now, as he looked at the painting, he saw the consequences of his choices. He realized that the portrait had come to __________ his sins, hiding them from the world while his true self withered beneath the surface.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "exaggerate", "B": "glorify", "C": "conceal", "D": "reflect", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Conceal\nChoice A, \"conceal,\" is the best answer because it aligns with the idea that the portrait hides Dorian\u2019s true, corrupted nature. The passage suggests that the painting serves to mask the negative effects of his actions, allowing him to maintain his outward appearance of youth and beauty.\nB is incorrect because \"glorify\" suggests that the portrait enhances or celebrates Dorian\u2019s behavior, which contrasts with the passage\u2019s implication that the portrait is a cover for his internal decay.\nC is incorrect because \"exaggerate\" implies that the portrait amplifies the consequences of Dorian\u2019s actions, which doesn\u2019t fit with the idea that the portrait hides his sins.\nD is incorrect because \"reflect\" would imply that the portrait shows Dorian\u2019s true nature, but the text suggests the opposite\u2014it's concealing his moral decline."}
