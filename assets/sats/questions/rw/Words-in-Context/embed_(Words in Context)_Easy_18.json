{"introduction": "The following text is from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. Pip reflects on his feelings toward Estella and the complex nature of their relationship.", "text": "Pip watched Estella with a sense of longing and confusion. She had always been beautiful, but her beauty now seemed almost unattainable. He admired her from afar, but each time she looked at him with disdain, he felt a deep pang of hurt. Despite the pain, Pip could not shake his feelings for her. He wondered why he was so captivated by someone who treated him with such indifference. Her beauty seemed to have a power over him, and he began to feel that it was the most __________ aspect of her, more so than her personality or kindness, which he struggled to understand.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "evident", "B": "superficial", "C": "intimidating", "D": "complex", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Intimidating\nChoice B, \"intimidating,\" is the best answer because it aligns with Pip's reaction to Estella. The text indicates that Pip feels both awe and pain in response to her beauty, and \"intimidating\" fits the emotional reaction of being overwhelmed or made to feel inferior by something so unattainable.\nA is incorrect because \"evident\" would imply that her beauty is easily understood or clear, whereas the passage suggests it overwhelms Pip and leaves him confused.\nC is incorrect because \"superficial\" suggests something shallow or of little substance, which doesn\u2019t fit the tone of awe and deep emotional reaction conveyed in the text.\nD is incorrect because while \"complex\" could describe Estella\u2019s character in general, the passage focuses more on the overwhelming and intimidating nature of her beauty, not the complexity of her character."}
