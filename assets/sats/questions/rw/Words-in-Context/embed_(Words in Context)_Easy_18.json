	"introduction": "The following text is from a study on social media trends and the influence of viral content on user behavior.",
	"text": "Once a trend gathers momentum, even skeptical users often feel compelled to follow along, as though the collective force behind the movement renders any dissent __________.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "conspicuous",
	"B": "untenable",
	"C": "precarious",
	"D": "magnanimous",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B, \"untenable,\" implies that opposition is not defensible or supportable once everyone else is participating. \"Conspicuous\" just means easily noticed, \"precarious\" suggests uncertainty, and \"magnanimous\" means generous or noble, none of which capture the impossibility of dissent."
