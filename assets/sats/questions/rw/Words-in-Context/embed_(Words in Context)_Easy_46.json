{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on the allure of Jay Gatsby and his extravagant lifestyle.", "text": "Nick watched as Gatsby stood on the balcony, overlooking the party guests below. The mansion was alive with laughter, music, and the sparkle of champagne glasses, yet Gatsby remained distant, almost detached from the revelry. Nick had always been fascinated by Gatsby\u2019s ability to command attention without fully participating in the celebrations. It was as if Gatsby\u2019s charm lay not in his actions but in the mystery that surrounded him. Nick realized that Gatsby\u2019s allure seemed to __________ the guests, drawing them in with the promise of something they could never fully understand.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "captivate", "B": "conceal", "C": "repel", "D": "diminish", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Captivate\nChoice C, \"captivate,\" is the best answer because it fits the context of Gatsby's mysterious and magnetic presence. The passage suggests that Gatsby attracts people through his enigmatic nature, even though he is distant and detached from the party itself. His mystery, rather than his actions, is what draws people in.\nA is incorrect because \"repel\" means to drive people away, which is the opposite of what Gatsby\u2019s presence does.\nB is incorrect because \"conceal\" implies hiding or covering up, but Gatsby\u2019s allure comes from what he reveals through his mysterious aura, not what he hides.\nD is incorrect because \"diminish\" suggests making something less important, which contradicts the idea of Gatsby\u2019s ability to draw people in and hold their attention."}
