{"introduction": "The following text is from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Victor Frankenstein reflects on the aftermath of his creation and the isolation he feels.", "text": "Victor sat alone in his study, his hands trembling as he recalled the moment he brought the creature to life. The horror of that moment still haunted him, and he could not escape the growing sense of responsibility and dread that had taken over his life. His ambition had led him to this point, but now it was clear that the consequences of his actions were far worse than he had ever imagined. Victor realized that his desire for knowledge had begun to __________ him, pushing him to the brink of madness and making him lose all sense of reason.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "consume", "B": "empower", "C": "enlighten", "D": "distract", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Consume\nChoice C, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Victor's obsession with creating life has taken over his entire existence. His desire for knowledge and success has overwhelmed him, leading to his physical and mental decline.\nA is incorrect because \"enlighten\" implies gaining knowledge or wisdom, which contradicts the passage where Victor's actions have led to confusion and suffering, not enlightenment.\nB is incorrect because \"empower\" suggests that Victor's ambition gives him strength or control, whereas the passage indicates that it weakens him emotionally and physically.\nD is incorrect because \"distract\" would imply that his ambition is preventing him from focusing, but instead, it is completely overtaking his thoughts and actions, leading to a loss of control."}
