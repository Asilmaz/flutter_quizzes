{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on the troubled relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff.", "text": "Nelly stood by the window, watching the wild moors stretch out before her. She had witnessed the bond between Catherine and Heathcliff from its earliest days\u2014an intense connection, full of both passion and cruelty. Their love was not a simple, tender affection; it was something far more complicated. Over time, their relationship had become increasingly destructive, pulling them both into a cycle of obsession and revenge. Nelly could see that their love had begun to __________ them, consuming all their energy and leaving no room for peace or forgiveness.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "undermine", "B": "define", "C": "sustain", "D": "liberate", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Undermine\nChoice D, \"undermine,\" is the best answer because it captures how Catherine and Heathcliff\u2019s obsessive relationship erodes their happiness and well-being. The passage suggests that their love has a negative impact, weakening them both emotionally and mentally, leading to destruction rather than growth.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" would suggest that their relationship frees them in some way, but the passage shows that it imprisons them in a cycle of pain and obsession.\nB is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that their relationship is shaping their identity in a clear, structured way, but instead, it is destabilizing them.\nC is incorrect because \"sustain\" would imply that their love keeps them strong or ongoing, but the passage indicates that their relationship is having the opposite effect, breaking them down over time."}
