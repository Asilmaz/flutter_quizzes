{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on the character of Daisy Buchanan.", "text": "Nick stood at the edge of the crowd at one of Gatsby\u2019s extravagant parties, his eyes scanning the room. Daisy stood across the room, glowing in a way that made it impossible for Nick to look away. She had always been beautiful, but tonight there was something different about her\u2014something deeper, more complex. She was no longer just a vision of perfect beauty; there was a sense of vulnerability in her eyes, a glimpse of a woman who had lived through both joy and sorrow. Nick realized that Daisy\u2019s charm lay not in her outward appearance but in her __________ nature, which seemed to combine both innocence and experience in a way that left him captivated.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "contradictory", "B": "superficial", "C": "captivating", "D": "na\u00efve", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Contradictory\nChoice B, \"contradictory,\" is the best answer because it fits the complexity of Daisy\u2019s character as described in the passage. Nick perceives Daisy as a combination of innocence and experience, which are opposing qualities that create a sense of contradiction and intrigue about her.\nA is incorrect because \"superficial\" suggests something shallow, but the passage emphasizes Daisy\u2019s deeper, more complex nature.\nC is incorrect because \"captivating\" would describe the effect Daisy has on others, but it doesn\u2019t address the internal complexity of her character, which the passage highlights.\nD is incorrect because \"na\u00efve\" implies a lack of experience, which doesn\u2019t align with the passage\u2019s description of Daisy having both innocence and experience."}
