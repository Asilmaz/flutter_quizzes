{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her changing opinion of Mr. Darcy after learning more about him.", "text": "Elizabeth sat alone in her room, contemplating the events of the past few days. Her feelings toward Mr. Darcy had been complicated from the beginning\u2014his initial pride and aloofness had made her think poorly of him. Yet, as she learned more about his actions, particularly his efforts to help her sister, Lydia, Elizabeth began to see him in a different light. She realized that her early judgment of him had been hasty and that, despite his faults, Mr. Darcy possessed a deep sense of __________, one that had motivated many of his actions and decisions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "selfishness", "B": "integrity", "C": "vanity", "D": "indifference", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Integrity\nChoice B, \"integrity,\" is the best answer because it fits the context of Elizabeth's changing opinion of Mr. Darcy. The passage suggests that despite his pride and aloofness, Darcy's actions show a deeper moral quality, and \"integrity\" reflects this shift in Elizabeth\u2019s perception.\nA is incorrect because \"selfishness\" would suggest that Mr. Darcy is primarily concerned with his own interests, which contradicts the idea that his actions were motivated by a deeper moral sense.\nC is incorrect because \"vanity\" suggests excessive pride in oneself, but the passage indicates that Elizabeth\u2019s reassessment of Darcy involves recognizing a quality of moral character, not self-centeredness.\nD is incorrect because \"indifference\" implies a lack of concern or empathy, which is the opposite of what the passage suggests about Darcy\u2019s motivations."}
