{"introduction": "The following text is from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Jane reflects on her feelings towards Mr. Rochester as she begins to learn more about his troubled past.", "text": "Jane stood in the quiet garden, her thoughts lingering on Mr. Rochester. She had always admired him for his intelligence and strength, but recently, she had begun to notice a deeper sadness in his eyes. He carried a burden that seemed to weigh on him, something that he had never fully shared with her. As she pondered his silence, Jane wondered if the truth about his past would ever come to light. She realized that despite her growing affection for him, she could never fully understand him unless he was willing to __________ the secrets that haunted him.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "exaggerate", "B": "defend", "C": "deny", "D": "reveal", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Reveal\nChoice A, \"reveal,\" is the best answer because it logically fits the context of Jane\u2019s need for transparency in her relationship with Mr. Rochester. The passage indicates that Jane is seeking the truth about his past, and the only way she can understand him is if he chooses to \"reveal\" his secrets.\nB is incorrect because \"defend\" implies that Mr. Rochester needs to justify or argue for his actions, which is not the issue at hand. Jane is seeking the truth, not a defense.\nC is incorrect because \"deny\" would suggest that Mr. Rochester should reject or refuse to acknowledge his past, which contradicts Jane\u2019s desire for him to share it.\nD is incorrect because \"exaggerate\" would imply that Mr. Rochester should make his past seem worse than it is, which does not fit Jane\u2019s search for honest understanding."}
