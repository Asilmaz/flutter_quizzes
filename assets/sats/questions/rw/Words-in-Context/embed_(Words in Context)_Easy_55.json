{"introduction": "The following text is from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Rodion Raskolnikov reflects on his troubled conscience after committing a crime.", "text": "Raskolnikov sat alone in his cramped room, his thoughts a whirlwind of guilt and confusion. The crime he had committed weighed heavily on him, and the more he tried to rationalize his actions, the more he felt the unbearable pressure of his conscience. He had thought he could escape the consequences, but now, as the days passed, he realized that his crime had started to __________ him, filling him with dread and torment that he could no longer avoid. His mind had become a prison, and no matter where he went, the guilt followed.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "justify", "B": "liberate", "C": "enlighten", "D": "haunt", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Haunt\nChoice B, \"haunt,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects how Raskolnikov\u2019s guilt continuously troubles him, both mentally and emotionally. The passage suggests that the guilt is a constant presence that follows him wherever he goes, much like a haunting.\nA is incorrect because \"justify\" would imply that Raskolnikov\u2019s guilt is providing some kind of rational or moral justification for his crime, which is not the case. His guilt is overwhelming, not supportive.\nC is incorrect because \"enlighten\" implies that the guilt brings clarity or understanding, which is contrary to the passage\u2019s focus on torment and confusion.\nD is incorrect because \"liberate\" would suggest freedom or release, but the passage clearly shows that the guilt is entangling Raskolnikov further, not setting him free."}
