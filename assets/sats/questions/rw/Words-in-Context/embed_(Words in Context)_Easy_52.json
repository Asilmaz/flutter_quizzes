{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on Mr. Darcy\u2019s character after learning more about his actions.", "text": "Elizabeth sat by the window, looking out at the darkening sky. She had long thought of Mr. Darcy as proud and arrogant, but her recent discoveries about him made her reconsider her opinion. She had learned that he had acted with great generosity and integrity toward her family, and this revelation left her conflicted. As she thought more about it, she realized that Mr. Darcy\u2019s actions had begun to __________ her judgment of him, forcing her to acknowledge that her initial assumptions had been too hasty.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "distort", "B": "validate", "C": "challenge", "D": "reinforce", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Challenge\nChoice C, \"challenge,\" is the best answer because it reflects how new information about Mr. Darcy is causing Elizabeth to question and reassess her initial judgment of him. The passage indicates that her earlier assumptions are being reconsidered, not confirmed.\nA is incorrect because \"distort\" would suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s judgment is becoming more warped or twisted, but the passage describes a thoughtful reassessment, not a distortion.\nB is incorrect because \"validate\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s assumptions were correct all along, which is not the case. She is realizing her assumptions were wrong.\nD is incorrect because \"reinforce\" would imply that new information is strengthening her original opinion, but the passage shows her opinion is shifting, not being supported."}
