{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her feelings after Mr. Darcy's unexpected proposal.", "text": "Elizabeth sat by the window, her thoughts in turmoil. Mr. Darcy\u2019s sudden proposal had taken her completely by surprise, and although his words had been earnest, she could not forget the arrogance and condescension with which he had spoken about her family. His proposal had seemed to come from nowhere, leaving her confused about his true feelings. As she reflected on it, Elizabeth realized that her initial anger had begun to __________, replaced by a more complicated sense of doubt and uncertainty about what she truly felt for him.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "intensify", "B": "clarify", "C": "subside", "D": "validate", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Subside\nChoice B, \"subside,\" is the best answer because it reflects the idea that Elizabeth\u2019s initial anger is starting to fade, giving way to more complicated feelings of doubt and uncertainty. The passage shows her emotional response becoming less intense.\nA is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s anger is growing stronger, which contradicts the passage\u2019s indication that her anger is diminishing.\nC is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that her feelings are becoming clearer, but the passage suggests she is becoming more uncertain, not clearer.\nD is incorrect because \"validate\" would imply that her feelings of anger are being justified, but the passage indicates that her feelings are shifting away from anger and toward doubt."}
