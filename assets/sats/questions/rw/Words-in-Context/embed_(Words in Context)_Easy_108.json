{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on the relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff.", "text": "Nelly watched Catherine and Heathcliff from a distance, noting the intensity of their interactions. The two of them had always been close, but there was something different now. Catherine\u2019s emotions were more volatile than ever, and Heathcliff\u2019s presence seemed to stir both love and anger in her. Nelly knew that their bond was far from healthy, but she also understood that it was inextricable. It was as if their feelings for each other began to __________ them, causing them to lash out at the world around them even as they drew closer to one another.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "complicate", "B": "define", "C": "consume", "D": "empower", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Consume\nChoice D, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects how Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship has become all-encompassing, affecting their emotions and actions in destructive ways. The passage indicates that their feelings have overwhelmed them, leading to negative behaviors while still pulling them together.\nA is incorrect because \"complicate\" would suggest that their feelings make things more complex but not necessarily overpower them; \"consume\" suggests a deeper, more overwhelming effect.\nB is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that their relationship shapes or clarifies their identities, but the passage shows their feelings as leading to destruction and turmoil.\nC is incorrect because \"empower\" implies that their relationship gives them strength, but the passage indicates that it is instead weakening them emotionally."}
