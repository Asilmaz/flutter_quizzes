The passage suggests that her emotions are now more conflicted, rather than straightforward or simple.\nA is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that Jane's feelings are growing stronger, but the passage suggests that her feelings are becoming more mixed and confused, not stronger.\nC is incorrect because \"diminish\" would imply that Jane's feelings are lessening, but the passage doesn't suggest that her admiration is fading; rather, it is becoming more complex.\nD is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that Jane\u2019s feelings have become simpler or clearer, but the passage shows that they are becoming more complicated due to new revelations."}
