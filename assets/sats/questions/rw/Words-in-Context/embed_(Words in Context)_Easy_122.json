He realized that his ambition had begun to __________ him, leading him to disregard the consequences of his actions and the suffering he had caused.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "empower", "B": "liberate", "C": "consume", "D": "confuse", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Consume\nChoice B, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Victor's ambition has taken over his thoughts and actions, to the point of making him disregard the consequences. The passage suggests that his ambition has overwhelmed him, leading to his eventual regret.\nA is incorrect because \"empower\" would suggest that his ambition is making him stronger or more capable, but the passage shows that his ambition is leading him to regret and despair, not empowerment.\nC is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply that Victor's ambition is freeing him in some way, but the passage indicates that it is trapping him in guilt and regret.\nD is incorrect because \"confuse\" would suggest that his ambition is making him unclear about his actions, but the passage shows that his regret is clear; his ambition simply led him to ignore the consequences."}
