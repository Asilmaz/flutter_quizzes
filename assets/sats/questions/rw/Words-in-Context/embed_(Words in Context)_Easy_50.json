{"introduction": "The following text is from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hester Prynne reflects on her life after receiving her punishment.", "text": "Hester Prynne stood in front of the crowd, her head held high despite the shame she felt. The scarlet letter on her chest was a constant reminder of her sin, yet over time, it had become something more. What began as a symbol of disgrace had slowly transformed into something that others began to view with awe, a symbol of Hester\u2019s strength and resilience. As she thought about how her punishment had shaped her, Hester realized that the letter had begun to __________ her character, not just marking her past but also defining her present.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "obscure", "B": "reveal", "C": "hinder", "D": "enhance", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Enhance\nChoice D, \"enhance,\" is the best answer because it reflects how the scarlet letter, originally a mark of shame, has come to symbolize Hester\u2019s strength and resilience over time. The passage shows that the letter has transformed her character in a positive way, enhancing her identity.\nA is incorrect because \"obscure\" means to hide or make something less visible, which contradicts the idea that the letter has come to symbolize Hester\u2019s strength.\nB is incorrect because \"reveal\" implies exposing something hidden, but the letter has already been a public symbol of her sin and later becomes a symbol of her strength.\nC is incorrect because \"hinder\" suggests that the letter would prevent or restrict Hester\u2019s development, but the passage indicates that it actually contributes positively to her character."}
