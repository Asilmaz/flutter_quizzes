	"introduction": "The following text is from a literary critique on an author’s stylistic evolution over successive novels.",
	"text": "As the writer matured, critics noted a remarkable shift from ornate and elaborate sentences to a more __________ style that relied on precision and subtlety for impact.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "lugubrious",
	"B": "unadorned",
	"C": "hypothetical",
	"D": "expeditious",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B, \"unadorned,\" directly contrasts with \"ornate and elaborate.\" It suggests simplicity and clarity. \"Lugubrious\" means mournful, which doesn’t relate to style, \"hypothetical\" refers to supposition, and \"expeditious\" means fast or efficient rather than plain."
