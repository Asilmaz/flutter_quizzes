{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Heathcliff\u2019s troubled nature and his relationship with Catherine Earnshaw.", "text": "Heathcliff\u2019s obsession with Catherine had only deepened in the years since her marriage to Edgar Linton. He could not accept the idea of her being with another man, and the bitterness in his heart grew stronger with each passing day. Despite his hardened demeanor, Nelly saw glimpses of the pain he kept hidden beneath his anger. It was clear that his feelings for Catherine were no longer about love, but about something darker\u2014something that sought to __________ her happiness, perhaps even her life. It was as if his mind had twisted to the point where his devotion to her had become a destructive force rather than a source of affection.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "support", "B": "enhance", "C": "conceal", "D": "hinder", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Hinder\nChoice B, \"hinder,\" is the best answer because it logically fits the context of Heathcliff\u2019s emotions. His feelings for Catherine are described as having become destructive, preventing her happiness rather than helping it. \"Hinder\" means to obstruct or prevent, which aligns with the sense that his obsession is blocking Catherine\u2019s well-being.\nA is incorrect because \"support\" implies helping or assisting, which contradicts the passage\u2019s description of Heathcliff\u2019s feelings as a negative force.\nC is incorrect because \"conceal\" means to hide or keep something secret, but the passage focuses on how Heathcliff\u2019s emotions are actively affecting Catherine\u2019s happiness rather than keeping it hidden.\nD is incorrect because \"enhance\" means to improve or make something greater, which contrasts with the destructive nature of Heathcliff\u2019s obsession."}
