{"introduction": "The following text is from The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett. Mary Lennox reflects on her life at Misselthwaite Manor.", "text": "Mary stood at the window of her new room, looking out at the wild garden she had discovered. It seemed so overgrown, so full of mystery, that it almost felt as though it were hiding something from her. For the first time in a long while, she felt a sense of wonder and curiosity that she had never experienced in India. The garden\u2019s beauty was hidden behind its wildness, and Mary began to sense that there was something more to it than she could see. As she stood there, she realized that the garden was not just a place, but a __________, a key to unlocking the secrets she had yet to understand.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "burden", "B": "treasure", "C": "mystery", "D": "barrier", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Mystery\nChoice D, \"mystery,\" is the best answer because it fits the context of the text. Mary\u2019s sense of curiosity and wonder as she gazes at the garden implies that it holds secrets she has yet to uncover. The garden is described as \"hiding something\" and \"full of mystery,\" making \"mystery\" the most appropriate word.\nA is incorrect because \"burden\" suggests something heavy or difficult to bear, which doesn\u2019t align with the positive, curious tone of Mary\u2019s feelings toward the garden.\nB is incorrect because \"treasure\" implies something valuable that is already found, while the passage focuses on the potential to discover something hidden or unknown, which is better captured by \"mystery.\"\nC is incorrect because \"barrier\" would imply something that obstructs or prevents understanding, but the passage suggests the garden is an opportunity for discovery, not an obstacle."}
