{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her changing feelings toward Mr. Darcy after learning more about his character.", "text": "Elizabeth sat at her writing desk, the letter from Mr. Darcy still in her hand. She had been shocked by the revelations, but as she read his letter again, she began to reconsider her harsh judgment. His explanation for his past actions made her see him in a new light. Elizabeth realized that her opinion of Mr. Darcy had begun to __________, as she moved from disdain to a more measured understanding of his true character.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "clarify", "B": "distort", "C": "intensify", "D": "soften", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Soften\nChoice A, \"soften,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Elizabeth\u2019s feelings toward Mr. Darcy have become less harsh and more understanding. The passage shows a shift from negative judgment to a more balanced and thoughtful view.\nB is incorrect because \"distort\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s opinion is becoming more inaccurate or skewed, but the passage suggests that she is gaining a clearer, more empathetic view, not distorting her perception.\nC is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that Elizabeth's feelings toward Mr. Darcy are growing stronger in a negative way, but the passage indicates a shift toward more understanding, not increased intensity.\nD is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that her feelings are becoming simpler or clearer, but the passage emphasizes a softening of her feelings, not just a clarification of them."}
