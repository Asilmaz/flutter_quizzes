{"introduction": "The following text is from To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. Scout Finch reflects on her father, Atticus Finch, and the way he is regarded by the people in their town.", "text": "As Scout walked through the streets of Maycomb, she overheard whispers from the townspeople about her father, Atticus. They spoke in hushed tones, and their words were filled with a mixture of admiration and resentment. To the townspeople, Atticus represented something different\u2014an ideal of fairness and justice that seemed out of place in a town steeped in prejudice. Scout couldn't help but feel proud of her father, but she also noticed how the townspeople seemed to __________ his integrity, either questioning it or trying to diminish it.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "conceal", "B": "diminish", "C": "reflect", "D": "praise", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Diminish\nChoice A, \"diminish,\" is the best answer because it reflects the idea that the townspeople are subtly undermining or reducing Atticus\u2019s integrity, even if they admire him. The text suggests that although they respect him, they also seek to diminish or downplay his principles in the context of their own prejudices.\nB is incorrect because \"conceal\" implies hiding something, but in this case, the townspeople\u2019s feelings are not about hiding Atticus's integrity but rather downplaying it.\nC is incorrect because \"reflect\" suggests an honest or thoughtful consideration, which does not align with the townspeople\u2019s attitude of questioning or diminishing his integrity.\nD is incorrect because \"praise\" would suggest approval and acknowledgment of Atticus\u2019s actions, but the passage shows how the townspeople are more critical than admiring."}
