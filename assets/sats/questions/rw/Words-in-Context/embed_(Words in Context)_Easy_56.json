{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on the destructive relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff.", "text": "Nelly watched as Catherine stood on the moors, her eyes fixed on the horizon. She had always been a passionate and impulsive woman, but lately, her behavior had become even more erratic. She was torn between her love for Heathcliff and her desire for a more stable life with Edgar Linton. Nelly could see that Catherine's feelings for Heathcliff were no longer simple affection\u2014they had become an obsession that seemed to __________ her, making it impossible for her to find peace, even for a moment.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "clarify", "C": "overwhelm", "D": "justify", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Overwhelm\nChoice B, \"overwhelm,\" is the best answer because it captures how Catherine\u2019s obsession with Heathcliff has taken over her emotions and mind. The passage suggests that Catherine is consumed by her feelings for him, unable to find peace.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests freedom or release, but Catherine\u2019s obsession is preventing her from feeling free or at ease.\nC is incorrect because \"clarify\" implies making things clearer, but Catherine\u2019s obsession with Heathcliff is making her emotions more confused and complicated, not clearer.\nD is incorrect because \"justify\" would imply that Catherine\u2019s obsession somehow makes sense or is rational, but the passage conveys that it is a disruptive, uncontrollable force."}
