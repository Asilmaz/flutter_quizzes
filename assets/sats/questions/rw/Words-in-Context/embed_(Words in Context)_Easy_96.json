{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotional state after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly stood at the window, watching Catherine as she walked slowly through the garden, her thoughts clearly troubled. Since her marriage to Edgar Linton, Catherine had become increasingly withdrawn and conflicted. She seemed unable to escape the memories of her past love for Heathcliff, and it was clear that her marriage was not the source of happiness she had hoped it would be. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff continued to __________ her, holding her back from fully embracing her life with Edgar.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "consume", "B": "define", "C": "stabilize", "D": "liberate", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Consume\nChoice A, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it reflects the idea that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff have overtaken her emotional state, preventing her from moving forward in her marriage. The passage indicates that these feelings are all-encompassing, leaving her unable to fully embrace her new life.\nB is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that her feelings are shaping her identity in a way that is positive, but the passage shows that her love for Heathcliff is actually causing her inner turmoil.\nC is incorrect because \"stabilize\" implies that her emotions are becoming more balanced or settled, but Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff are keeping her in a state of conflict.\nD is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests that her feelings for Heathcliff are setting her free, but in reality, they are causing her emotional distress and preventing her from finding peace."}
