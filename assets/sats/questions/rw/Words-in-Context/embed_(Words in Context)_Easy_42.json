{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Heathcliff's actions and the growing tension at Wuthering Heights.", "text": "Nelly stood in the doorway, watching Heathcliff as he strode through the moors, his face shadowed with something dark and resolute. Ever since Catherine\u2019s death, he had become a man consumed by bitterness and revenge. His every action seemed to be driven by an unspoken desire to settle old scores, and no one was safe from his wrath. Nelly couldn't help but feel that Heathcliff\u2019s obsession with the past had begun to __________ his life, overshadowing everything else and leaving no room for peace or reconciliation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "hinder", "B": "liberate", "C": "dominate", "D": "clarify", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Dominate\nChoice B, \"dominate,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Heathcliff\u2019s obsession with revenge and the past has taken over his life. The passage indicates that this obsession has become the central driving force behind his actions, leaving little room for anything else, including peace or healing.\nA is incorrect because \"hinder\" suggests that the obsession is preventing Heathcliff from achieving something, whereas the passage describes it as completely taking over his life, not hindering him.\nC is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply freedom or release, which is the opposite of Heathcliff\u2019s situation, where his obsession keeps him trapped in bitterness.\nD is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that his obsession makes things clearer, but instead, it causes confusion and prevents resolution."}
