{"introduction": "The following text is from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle. Dr. Watson reflects on the strange case that Sherlock Holmes has taken up.", "text": "Dr. Watson sat in his study, perplexed by the latest case Sherlock Holmes had brought to him. There were few details to go on, but Holmes had been intrigued by a series of seemingly unrelated clues. As Watson considered the matter, he realized how much he relied on Holmes\u2019s exceptional ability to see connections where others saw only chaos. Watson had often wondered how Holmes\u2019s mind worked, how he could __________ even the most convoluted mysteries and find a way to make sense of them.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "unravel", "B": "ignore", "C": "complicate", "D": "imitate", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Unravel\nChoice B, \"unravel,\" is the best answer because it captures the idea of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s ability to solve complex mysteries. \"Unravel\" implies taking something complex or tangled and resolving it into a clear solution, which fits Holmes\u2019s skill in dealing with seemingly impossible cases.\nA is incorrect because \"ignore\" would suggest that Holmes overlooks mysteries, which is the opposite of his investigative approach.\nC is incorrect because \"complicate\" implies making things more difficult, while Holmes\u2019s skill lies in simplifying and solving mysteries, not complicating them further.\nD is incorrect because \"imitate\" suggests copying others, whereas Holmes\u2019s talent is in uniquely solving mysteries by observing and reasoning in ways no one else does."}
