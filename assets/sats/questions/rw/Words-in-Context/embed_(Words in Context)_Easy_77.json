{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotional state after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly stood by the window, observing Catherine as she gazed out over the moors. Catherine had always been a passionate, headstrong woman, but since her marriage to Edgar Linton, she had changed. She seemed restless, torn between the stability of her marriage and her deep, unresolved feelings for Heathcliff. Nelly could see that Catherine's heart was no longer fully in her marriage, and she began to realize that Catherine\u2019s emotional conflict had started to __________ her well-being, making it impossible for her to truly find peace.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "strengthen", "B": "stabilize", "C": "enlighten", "D": "deteriorate", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Deteriorate\nChoice C, \"deteriorate,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s emotional conflict is harming her overall health and well-being. The passage suggests that Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings are causing a decline in her emotional state.\nA is incorrect because \"strengthen\" would imply that her emotional turmoil is making her stronger, which contradicts the idea of her deteriorating.\nB is incorrect because \"stabilize\" suggests that her emotional state is becoming more balanced, while the passage conveys a sense of increasing distress and imbalance.\nD is incorrect because \"enlighten\" implies gaining understanding or clarity, but Catherine\u2019s conflict is causing confusion and suffering, not clarity."}
