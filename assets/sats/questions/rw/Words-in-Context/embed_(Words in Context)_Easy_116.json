{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotional state after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly sat by the fire, watching Catherine as she stared out at the moors. Catherine had always been an unpredictable, passionate woman, but since her marriage to Edgar Linton, she seemed to be a shadow of her former self. The vibrant energy that once defined her had dimmed, replaced by a deep restlessness. Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s heart was still tied to Heathcliff, and she realized that Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings for him began to __________ her, causing her inner conflict and making it impossible for her to embrace her new life with Edgar.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "torment", "B": "liberate", "C": "define", "D": "clarify", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Torment\nChoice C, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings for Heathcliff are causing her emotional pain and internal conflict. The passage indicates that these feelings are preventing her from finding peace in her marriage to Edgar.\nA is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that Catherine\u2019s feelings give her clarity or purpose, but in reality, they are creating emotional turmoil and preventing her from fully embracing her new life.\nB is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff are freeing her in some way, but they are actually trapping her in distress and conflict.\nD is incorrect because \"clarify\" suggests that her feelings are becoming clearer, but the passage shows how her feelings are complicating her life, not helping her understand it more clearly."}
