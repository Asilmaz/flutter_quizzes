{"introduction": "The following text is from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Jane reflects on her feelings toward Mr. Rochester after learning about his first marriage.", "text": "Jane sat by the fire, her thoughts swirling as she thought about Mr. Rochester's confession. His first marriage had been a revelation she had never expected. Though she had come to admire his strength and intelligence, this new knowledge made her question everything. She could feel her feelings toward him begin to __________, as she struggled to reconcile the man she loved with the dark truths of his past.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "clarify", "B": "diminish", "C": "intensify", "D": "complicate", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Complicate\nChoice B, \"complicate,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Jane's feelings toward Mr. Rochester have become more complex and conflicted after learning about his first marriage. The passage suggests that her emotions are no longer straightforward and are now filled with mixed thoughts and emotions.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that Jane\u2019s feelings are becoming simpler or easier to understand, but the passage indicates that her emotions are becoming more difficult to navigate.\nC is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that Jane\u2019s feelings are becoming stronger, but the passage shows that her emotions are growing more conflicted, not simply more intense.\nD is incorrect because \"diminish\" would suggest that Jane\u2019s feelings are fading or lessening, but the passage indicates that they are becoming more complicated, not less."}
