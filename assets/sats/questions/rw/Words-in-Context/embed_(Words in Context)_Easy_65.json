{"introduction": "The following text is from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. Ishmael reflects on the journey he is about to undertake with Captain Ahab.", "text": "Ishmael stood on the deck of the <em>Pequod</em>, gazing out at the vast ocean. The ship was about to embark on a long and perilous journey, one that would take them deep into uncharted waters. Captain Ahab, though, was not concerned with the ordinary dangers of the sea. He was obsessed with one thing\u2014the white whale, Moby Dick. Ishmael couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of unease about the journey ahead. Ahab\u2019s single-minded pursuit of vengeance seemed to __________ the crew, and Ishmael feared that it would lead them all to disaster.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "unite", "B": "consume", "C": "empower", "D": "exhaust", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Consume\nChoice D, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Ahab\u2019s obsession with Moby Dick has taken over his mind and actions. The passage describes how Ahab\u2019s singular focus on vengeance is all-encompassing, overshadowing everything else, including the well-being of the crew.\nA is incorrect because \"unite\" suggests bringing people together in harmony, but Ahab\u2019s obsession is not uniting the crew; it is driving them apart and causing unease.\nB is incorrect because \"exhaust\" suggests physical or mental weariness, but the passage focuses on how Ahab's obsession is consuming him, not simply tiring him out.\nC is incorrect because \"empower\" suggests strength or encouragement, but Ahab\u2019s obsession is destructive, not empowering, to the crew."}
