{"introduction": "The following text is from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray reflects on his past actions and the consequences of his hedonistic lifestyle.", "text": "Dorian sat in front of his portrait, staring at the image of himself that had remained youthful and flawless while he had aged and deteriorated in reality. The longer he looked at the painting, the more he understood that his indulgence in pleasure had left him hollow. He had lived a life of excess, believing that he could escape the consequences of his actions. Now, however, it was clear that his past choices had only served to ______ the emptiness within him, making him long for something more meaningful but unsure of where to find it.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "worsen", "B": "justify", "C": "conceal", "D": "amplify", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Worsen\nChoice B, \"worsen,\" is the best answer because it fits the context of Dorian\u2019s realization that his indulgent lifestyle has led to a deep sense of emptiness. The passage suggests that his past actions have not alleviated his inner turmoil but have instead made it more pronounced, meaning they have worsened his condition.\nA is incorrect because \"justify\" would imply that Dorian\u2019s actions have made his situation seem more reasonable, which contradicts the sense of regret and emptiness conveyed in the text.\nC is incorrect because \"conceal\" would suggest that Dorian\u2019s actions hid or masked his emptiness, but the passage implies that they exposed or intensified it.\nD is incorrect because \"amplify\" would suggest an increase in intensity, but \"worsen\" better captures the negative impact of his indulgences, making \"amplify\" a less precise fit in this context."}
