{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her initial impressions of Mr. Darcy.", "text": "Elizabeth stood by the window, her thoughts turning to Mr. Darcy. When they first met, she had found him aloof and condescending, his manner dismissive of her and her family. His refusal to dance with her at the ball had confirmed her suspicions that he was prideful and arrogant. But as time passed and she learned more about him, Elizabeth began to wonder whether her judgment had been too quick. She realized that her initial perception of Mr. Darcy had begun to __________, as she uncovered the complexities of his character and his actions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "strengthen", "B": "clarify", "C": "soften", "D": "complicate", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Soften\nChoice C, \"soften,\" is the best answer because it reflects the idea that Elizabeth\u2019s initial harsh judgment of Mr. Darcy has become less severe as she learns more about him. The passage suggests that as Elizabeth understands him better, her feelings of anger and distrust begin to fade.\nA is incorrect because \"strengthen\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s negative feelings toward Mr. Darcy have grown stronger, which is not the case. She is reconsidering her initial impression.\nB is incorrect because \"clarify\" suggests that her judgment has become more definite or clearer, but the passage implies that her perception is becoming more balanced, not clearer.\nD is incorrect because \"complicate\" suggests that Elizabeth\u2019s feelings are becoming more confusing, but the passage indicates a softening of her judgment, not an increase in confusion."}
