{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her changing views of Mr. Darcy after receiving his letter.", "text": "Elizabeth sat by the fire, reading Mr. Darcy\u2019s letter for the third time. At first, she had been indignant and hurt by his words, but as she read them again, something in her began to shift. She could see the sincerity in his tone, and she realized that the situation was not as clear-cut as she had initially thought. Elizabeth\u2019s feelings toward Mr. Darcy seemed to __________, moving from resentment to a more open-minded view of his character.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "simplify", "B": "soften", "C": "clarify", "D": "distort", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Soften\nChoice C, \"soften,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Elizabeth's emotions, particularly her negative feelings toward Mr. Darcy, begin to diminish as she gains more understanding. The passage suggests a shift toward a more empathetic and balanced view.\nA is incorrect because \"simplify\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s feelings are becoming less complex, but the passage shows a shift from negative judgment to more balanced understanding, not simplification.\nB is incorrect because \"clarify\" suggests that Elizabeth's view is becoming clearer in a logical sense, but the passage focuses on emotional softening, not clarity.\nD is incorrect because \"distort\" would imply that Elizabeth's feelings are becoming twisted or misrepresented, but the passage shows a movement toward understanding, not distortion."}
