{"introduction": "The following text is from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray reflects on the changes he sees in his portrait and his inner conflict.", "text": "Dorian stood in front of the mirror, his eyes fixed on the portrait that hung on the wall. The painting was as flawless as ever, but Dorian knew that it concealed the reality of his life\u2014his sins, his indulgences, and his moral decay. He had lived a life of pleasure and excess, believing that his appearance could remain untouched by his actions. As he stared at the portrait, Dorian realized that it had become a symbol of his __________, a stark contrast to the facade he showed to the world.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "degradation", "B": "transformation", "C": "innocence", "D": "enlightenment", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Degradation\nChoice C, \"degradation,\" is the best answer because it accurately captures the idea that Dorian\u2019s portrait reflects the moral and physical decline that he has experienced as a result of his indulgent lifestyle. The contrast between the perfect portrait and his decaying soul represents this degradation.\nA is incorrect because \"innocence\" would imply purity or lack of wrongdoing, which contradicts the passage\u2019s description of Dorian\u2019s sinful life.\nB is incorrect because \"transformation\" suggests a positive or neutral change, but Dorian\u2019s change is one of moral decline, not improvement.\nD is incorrect because \"enlightenment\" suggests gaining knowledge or wisdom, which doesn\u2019t align with the passage's theme of Dorian\u2019s deteriorating state."}
