{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on the mysterious nature of Jay Gatsby.", "text": "Nick sat in his small apartment, his thoughts still filled with images of Gatsby\u2019s opulent parties and enigmatic personality. Gatsby had always been a figure of fascination, someone who seemed to exist both inside and outside the world around him. He was admired by many, yet hardly anyone seemed to know him truly. As Nick thought more about Gatsby\u2019s actions, he realized that there was a quality about him that seemed to __________ everyone who came into contact with him, drawing them into his world without ever revealing too much of himself.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "repel", "B": "captivate", "C": "confuse", "D": "isolate", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Captivate\nChoice C, \"captivate,\" is the best answer because it reflects Gatsby\u2019s magnetic charm. Despite his mysteriousness, Gatsby draws people into his world, which Nick observes, even though Gatsby remains an enigma.\nA is incorrect because \"repel\" means to push people away, which contradicts the passage where Gatsby\u2019s presence is described as drawing others in.\nB is incorrect because \"confuse\" would imply that Gatsby's nature causes misunderstanding, but the passage emphasizes his ability to captivate and attract, not create confusion.\nD is incorrect because \"isolate\" implies detaching others, which contradicts Gatsby\u2019s ability to engage and draw people in, despite his mysteriousness."}
