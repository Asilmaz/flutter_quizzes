{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Heathcliff\u2019s feelings after Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s death.", "text": "Nelly sat by the fire, watching Heathcliff as he stared at the darkened sky. Since Catherine\u2019s death, Heathcliff had changed. Once a man full of anger and passion, he had now become withdrawn, consumed by his grief. He seemed to be searching for something, but it was unclear what he hoped to find. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s death had begun to __________ him, leaving him trapped in sorrow and unable to move on from the past.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "torment", "C": "define", "D": "strengthen", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Torment\nChoice C, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine's death has deeply affected Heathcliff, causing him emotional pain and suffering. The passage suggests that his grief is consuming him, making it impossible for him to move forward.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply that Heathcliff\u2019s grief is freeing him in some way, but it is clearly trapping him in sorrow and preventing him from healing.\nB is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that his grief is shaping his identity in a clear and purposeful way, but the passage indicates that his grief is more of a burden, not something that gives him clarity or direction.\nD is incorrect because \"strengthen\" would suggest that Heathcliff is growing stronger or more resolute due to his grief, but the passage suggests that it is weakening him emotionally, not empowering him."}
