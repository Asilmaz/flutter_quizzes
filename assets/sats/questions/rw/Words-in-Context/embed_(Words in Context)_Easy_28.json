{"introduction": "The following text is from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray reflects on the changes in his character as he grows older.", "text": "Dorian stood in front of the mirror, his eyes tracing the lines of his face. He had always been youthful and beautiful, but now, as he looked at his reflection, he noticed subtle changes\u2014small signs of age creeping into his features. Yet, despite these changes, his portrait remained as flawless as ever. Dorian could not help but feel a strange sense of relief. It was as though the portrait had come to __________ his actions, serving as a shield from the consequences of his reckless lifestyle, allowing him to indulge without remorse.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "justify", "B": "reveal", "C": "reflect", "D": "exaggerate", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Justify\nChoice D, \"justify,\" is the best answer because it fits the context of Dorian's realization. His portrait acts as a shield, allowing him to escape the moral consequences of his actions. The word \"justify\" implies that the portrait makes his behavior seem acceptable or excusable, even though his actions are reckless and harmful.\nA is incorrect because \"exaggerate\" would imply that the portrait amplifies Dorian's actions, but the focus here is on the portrait protecting him from consequences, not inflating them.\nB is incorrect because \"reveal\" suggests that the portrait shows his true self, but in the passage, the portrait hides the effects of his actions, not exposes them.\nC is incorrect because \"reflect\" would imply that the portrait simply mirrors Dorian\u2019s appearance or nature, but the passage implies that the portrait actively shields him from the consequences of his actions."}
