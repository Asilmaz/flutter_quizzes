{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on his experiences at Gatsby\u2019s parties.", "text": "Nick sat in the corner of Gatsby\u2019s grand mansion, observing the lavish spectacle before him. The music, the laughter, and the clinking of glasses filled the air as guests danced and mingled, many of whom Nick had never seen before. Despite the extravagance, Nick couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that there was something hollow about it all. The guests, though full of life and energy, seemed to be driven by something superficial, as if they were all there to __________, but never truly connect with one another.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "celebrate", "B": "escape", "C": "indulge", "D": "perform", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Perform\nChoice C, \"perform,\" is the best answer because it reflects the idea that the guests at Gatsby's party are acting or putting on a show for one another. The passage highlights the superficiality of their behavior, suggesting that they are playing roles rather than forming genuine connections.\nA is incorrect because \"celebrate\" implies a sense of joy or accomplishment, but the passage suggests a lack of true meaning behind their actions, not a celebration.\nB is incorrect because \"escape\" would imply that the guests are trying to flee from something, but the passage emphasizes their superficial interactions rather than their desire to escape reality.\nD is incorrect because \"indulge\" suggests giving in to desires, but \"perform\" more accurately captures the sense of people acting in a way that is not sincere or authentic."}
