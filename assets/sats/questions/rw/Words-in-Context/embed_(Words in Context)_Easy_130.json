{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Heathcliff\u2019s behavior after Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s death.", "text": "Nelly watched Heathcliff as he stood by Catherine\u2019s grave, his face shadowed with grief. Since her death, he had become more unpredictable, consumed by a mixture of longing and rage. The deep bond he had shared with her seemed to have broken something inside him, and Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s passing had begun to __________ him, turning him from a man of passion into someone consumed entirely by sorrow and revenge.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "define", "C": "haunt", "D": "empower", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Haunt\nChoice B, \"haunt,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s death continues to torment Heathcliff, both emotionally and mentally. The passage suggests that her absence leaves him unable to move forward, with her memory lingering in his thoughts and actions.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" would suggest that Catherine\u2019s death frees Heathcliff from something, but instead, it has trapped him in grief and obsession.\nC is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that his grief is shaping him in a clear and purposeful way, but the passage focuses on his suffering and inability to move on, not clarity.\nD is incorrect because \"empower\" implies that Heathcliff is gaining strength or control, but instead, the passage shows how Catherine\u2019s death weakens him emotionally and mentally."}
