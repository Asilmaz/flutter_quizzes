He had always been youthful and beautiful, but now, as he looked at his reflection, he noticed subtle changes\u2014small signs of age creeping into his features. Yet, despite these changes, his portrait remained as flawless as ever. Dorian could not help but feel a strange sense of relief. It was as though the portrait had come to __________ his actions, hiding the truth of his reckless lifestyle from the world while he continued to indulge without remorse.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "exaggerate", "B": "conceal", "C": "reflect", "D": "justify", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Conceal\nChoice D, \"conceal,\" is the best answer because it reflects how the portrait hides the effects of Dorian's actions.
