{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her changing feelings toward Mr. Darcy after learning more about him.", "text": "Elizabeth sat in her room, her mind racing with the new information she had learned about Mr. Darcy. At first, she had seen him as arrogant and self-centered, but as the layers of his character were revealed to her, she began to see him in a different light. She realized that her initial impression had been overly harsh. As she thought about his actions, particularly his generosity toward her family, she recognized that Mr. Darcy\u2019s character was more complex than she had initially believed. She began to feel that her judgment of him had been __________, and that perhaps she had misjudged him all along.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "idealized", "B": "justified", "C": "misguided", "D": "exaggerated", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Misguided\nChoice A, \"misguided,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Elizabeth now sees that her initial judgment of Mr. Darcy was wrong. The passage implies that her earlier assessment of him was not based on a full understanding of his character and was therefore misguided.\nB is incorrect because \"justified\" would imply that her judgment was reasonable and correct, which contradicts the passage where Elizabeth recognizes she was wrong.\nC is incorrect because \"idealized\" would suggest that Elizabeth saw Darcy as perfect, which isn't the case. She thought him arrogant and self-centered, not idealized.\nD is incorrect because \"exaggerated\" implies that her judgment was over the top, but the passage suggests a more fundamental misunderstanding, not just an overstatement."}
