{"introduction": "The following text is from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hester Prynne reflects on her public punishment and her changing sense of self.", "text": "Hester Prynne stood before the crowd, the scarlet letter burning into her chest, a permanent symbol of her sin. Yet, as she looked around at the judgmental faces, Hester felt a quiet strength growing within her. The shame she had once felt was no longer the only thing she saw in the letter. Over the years, the symbol had become a part of her identity, something that she had come to embrace. It no longer merely signified disgrace; it had come to __________ her resilience and her ability to endure, despite the condemnation of others.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "obscure", "B": "reveal", "C": "define", "D": "signify", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Define\nChoice B, \"define,\" is the best answer because it reflects how the scarlet letter has come to symbolize more than just Hester's shame. Over time, it represents her strength and resilience, shaping her identity and how she perceives herself.\nA is incorrect because \"obscure\" would mean to hide or make unclear, but the passage shows how the scarlet letter has come to represent Hester\u2019s strength, not obscure it.\nC is incorrect because \"reveal\" would suggest that the letter is uncovering something new about Hester, but the focus is on how it has come to shape and characterize her identity.\nD is incorrect because \"signify\" means to symbolize or stand for, but the passage implies a deeper shift\u2014where the letter doesn\u2019t just symbolize shame but has evolved to represent Hester's own sense of self and resilience."}
