{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her changing view of Mr. Darcy after reading his letter of explanation.", "text": "Elizabeth sat quietly, her hand still resting on Mr. Darcy\u2019s letter. When she had first received it, she had been angry and incredulous. The words had stung, particularly his confession of love, but as she read it again, she began to realize that perhaps she had been too harsh in her judgment. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that her opinion of him had begun to __________, moving from disdain to a more balanced and thoughtful view.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "soften", "B": "clarify", "C": "intensify", "D": "justify", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Soften\nChoice C, \"soften,\" is the best answer because it reflects the shift in Elizabeth's feelings toward Mr. Darcy from anger to understanding. The passage shows her emotions becoming less intense and more empathetic as she gains a clearer perspective.\nA is incorrect because \"intensify\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s negative feelings toward Mr. Darcy are growing stronger, which contradicts the passage where her feelings are becoming more balanced and less harsh.\nB is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that her emotions are becoming clearer in a positive sense, but the passage emphasizes a change in tone rather than understanding or simplification.\nD is incorrect because \"justify\" would imply that her feelings are being validated or supported, but the passage suggests she is reconsidering and softening her opinion, not confirming it."}
