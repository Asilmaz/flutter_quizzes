At first, she had been overwhelmed by his confession, but as she read the letter again, she began to feel something different. His words were sincere, but his explanation of his actions revealed a side of him she had not seen before. Elizabeth realized that her earlier opinion of Mr. Darcy had begun to __________, as she started to see him in a new light, understanding his motives and the complexity of his character.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "clarify", "B": "complicate", "C": "soften", "D": "distort", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Soften\nChoice B, \"soften,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Elizabeth's feelings toward Mr. Darcy have become less harsh and more understanding after reading his letter. The passage suggests a shift from negative judgment to a more thoughtful, nuanced view.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that her feelings are becoming more defined, but the passage emphasizes a shift in tone, not greater clarity.\nC is incorrect because \"complicate\" would imply that her feelings are becoming more confused or difficult to understand, but the passage suggests a more empathetic understanding, not confusion.\nD is incorrect because \"distort\" suggests that Elizabeth\u2019s view is becoming warped or inaccurate, but the passage shows her gaining a more balanced perspective, not distorting her feelings."}
