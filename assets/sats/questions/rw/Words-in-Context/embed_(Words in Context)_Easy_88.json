{"introduction": "The following text is from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Victor Frankenstein reflects on the moment he created the monster.", "text": "Victor stood in his laboratory, gazing at the lifeless form he had brought to life. The excitement he had felt earlier was now replaced by horror as he saw the monster open its eyes. His creation, which he had once believed would be a triumph of science, now filled him with dread. Victor realized that his ambition had led him to this point, and that the consequences of his actions would __________ him for the rest of his life, leaving him with a burden he could never escape.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "comfort", "B": "empower", "C": "haunt", "D": "liberate", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Haunt\nChoice B, \"haunt,\" is the best answer because it reflects how the consequences of Victor\u2019s actions will stay with him, tormenting him and filling him with guilt. The passage conveys that Victor\u2019s creation will continue to affect him long after the moment of creation.\nA is incorrect because \"comfort\" would suggest that the monster\u2019s creation brings Victor peace or relief, which contradicts the passage\u2019s tone of regret and horror.\nC is incorrect because \"empower\" would imply that Victor gains strength or control from his actions, which is not the case. His creation leads to fear and regret.\nD is incorrect because \"liberate\" implies freedom or release, whereas the passage describes how the consequences of Victor\u2019s ambition entrap him with guilt and sorrow."}
