She had been shocked by his sudden confession of love, but even more so by the explanation of his actions. His words, though eloquent, did not completely erase the sting of his earlier arrogance. Yet, as she read through his letter again, Elizabeth felt her emotions begin to shift. Her initial anger seemed to __________, and she found herself reconsidering her previous judgment of him. She could no longer ignore the sincerity in his words, and her feelings began to evolve.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "intensify", "B": "clarify", "C": "subside", "D": "justify", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Subside\nChoice B, \"subside,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Elizabeth\u2019s initial anger toward Mr. Darcy begins to fade as she considers his letter more thoughtfully. The passage suggests that her strong negative emotions are lessening.\nA is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that her anger grows stronger, but the passage shows her emotions becoming more complex and less intense.\nC is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that her feelings are becoming clearer, but the passage focuses on her anger diminishing, not her understanding becoming clearer.\nD is incorrect because \"justify\" would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s anger is being validated by the letter, but the passage suggests that her feelings are lessening, not being justified."}
