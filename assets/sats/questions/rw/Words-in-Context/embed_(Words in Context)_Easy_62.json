The passage emphasizes how Victor's abandonment and lack of care for the creature led to tragic consequences.\nA is incorrect because \"condemn\" means to express disapproval or punishment, which does not align with Victor\u2019s failure to care for the creature.\nB is incorrect because \"acknowledge\" suggests recognition, but the passage focuses more on Victor\u2019s lack of action and responsibility rather than recognition.\nD is incorrect because \"embrace\" implies accepting or welcoming, which contradicts Victor's abandonment of the creature."}
