{"introduction": "The following text is from The Odyssey by Homer. Odysseus reflects on his long journey home after the Trojan War.", "text": "Odysseus sat by the hearth, weary from his travels, his mind wandering over the countless adventures he had faced. He had encountered monsters, gods, and treacherous waters, all in his effort to return home. But even as he thought about the challenges that had tested him, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if his survival had been the result of mere chance or something more. After so many hardships, Odysseus realized that his continued existence was not just the result of fate or luck, but of his ability to __________ the trials he had faced and keep moving forward despite the odds.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "diminish", "B": "ignore", "C": "embrace", "D": "amplify", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Embrace\nChoice B, \"embrace,\" is the best answer because it reflects Odysseus\u2019s ability to accept and confront the hardships he has endured. The passage indicates that his survival has not been purely by chance but due to his resilience and ability to face challenges head-on, which \"embracing\" them implies.\nA is incorrect because \"diminish\" would suggest that Odysseus downplayed or reduced the significance of the trials, which contradicts the idea that he actively faced them.\nC is incorrect because \"ignore\" implies avoiding or dismissing challenges, which doesn\u2019t align with Odysseus\u2019s approach to overcoming them.\nD is incorrect because \"amplify\" would suggest increasing the difficulties, which doesn\u2019t fit the context of Odysseus surviving and moving forward despite them."}
