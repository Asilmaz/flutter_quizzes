{"introduction": "The following text is from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The narrator describes the character of Hester Prynne as she reflects on her public shaming.", "text": "Hester Prynne stood at the scaffold in the market-place, clutching her infant daughter in her arms. The crowd jeered and whispered as she was forced to wear the scarlet letter \"A\" on her chest, a symbol of her sin. Despite the shame and the scorn of the townspeople, Hester remained remarkably composed. As she thought about her life and the consequences of her actions, she realized that her public punishment, though humiliating, had not defined her. In fact, it had become something that __________ her, not as a symbol of disgrace, but as a mark of her strength and resilience.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "hindered", "B": "symbolized", "C": "empowered", "D": "concealed", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Empowered\nChoice D, \"empowered,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Hester's punishment, rather than weakening her, gives her strength and resolve. The passage describes how she transforms the scarlet letter from a symbol of shame into a mark of resilience, which suggests empowerment.\nA is incorrect because \"hindered\" means to limit or impede, which contradicts the context of Hester finding strength in her punishment.\nB is incorrect because \"symbolized\" would mean that the letter continued to represent shame, which is not the transformation described in the passage. Hester reinterprets the letter's meaning.\nC is incorrect because \"concealed\" would imply that the letter hides or masks something, but the text suggests that the letter's meaning evolves and becomes more powerful for Hester."}
