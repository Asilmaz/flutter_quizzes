{"introduction": "The following text is from Dracula by Bram Stoker. Mina Harker reflects on her experiences with Count Dracula and the increasing sense of danger.", "text": "Mina sat by the fire, her mind swirling with thoughts of the strange events that had unfolded since her arrival at Dracula's castle. She had initially been intrigued by the Count, but now she felt a growing unease about his behavior. He was polite, even charming, but there was something about him that felt unnatural. As she thought back on the past few days, Mina realized that the Count\u2019s presence seemed to __________ her sense of reality, clouding her judgment and making her feel increasingly isolated from the world around her.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "enhance", "B": "distort", "C": "confirm", "D": "liberate", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Distort\nChoice B, \"distort,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Dracula\u2019s presence is warping Mina\u2019s perception of reality. The passage suggests that Dracula is not only affecting Mina's judgment but also clouding her ability to see things clearly, which \"distort\" perfectly captures.\nA is incorrect because \"enhance\" would imply that Dracula's presence improves or sharpens Mina's reality, but the passage shows that it has the opposite effect.\nC is incorrect because \"confirm\" would imply that Dracula's presence supports or validates Mina\u2019s reality, whereas the text suggests that it confuses or distorts it.\nD is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply freedom, but Dracula\u2019s influence is making Mina feel more confined and uncertain, not liberated."}
