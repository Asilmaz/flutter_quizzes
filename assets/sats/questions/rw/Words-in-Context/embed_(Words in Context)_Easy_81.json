{"introduction": "The following text is from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Victor Frankenstein reflects on his guilt after creating the monster.", "text": "Victor sat in his study, consumed by guilt and regret. The monster he had created, whom he had abandoned, was now wreaking havoc on the lives of those he loved. Victor had been driven by an insatiable desire for knowledge and power, but now he realized that in his pursuit, he had failed to consider the consequences of his actions. He understood that his ambition had begun to __________ him, causing him to disregard the lives of others in favor of his own desires.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "clarify", "B": "blind", "C": "control", "D": "liberate", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Blind\nChoice C, \"blind,\" is the best answer because it accurately captures how Victor\u2019s ambition has clouded his judgment. The passage suggests that his single-minded pursuit of knowledge has prevented him from seeing the harm he has caused, making him \u201cblind\u201d to the consequences of his actions.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that his ambition made things clearer, but instead it is leading him to disregard important moral considerations.\nB is incorrect because \"control\" suggests that Victor\u2019s ambition is helping him manage his actions, but the passage shows that it\u2019s leading him to act recklessly.\nD is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests freedom, but Victor\u2019s ambition has trapped him in guilt and regret, not liberated him."}
