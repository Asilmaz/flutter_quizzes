{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Heathcliff's emotional state after Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s death.", "text": "Nelly sat by the fire, thinking of the years that had passed since Catherine\u2019s death. Heathcliff had never been the same after losing her; the fire that once burned brightly in him had turned to something darker. His grief was all-consuming, and yet, it seemed to have a strange power over him, as if he were trapped in a cycle of sorrow and vengeance. Nelly knew that Heathcliff\u2019s obsession with Catherine was not a simple form of mourning, but something that seemed to __________ him, making it impossible for him to move on from the past.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "sustain", "C": "clarify", "D": "overwhelm", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Overwhelm\nChoice B, \"overwhelm,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects how Heathcliff\u2019s grief consumes him. The passage suggests that his emotional state is so intense that it completely takes over, preventing him from moving on.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" means to free or release, which contradicts the idea of Heathcliff being trapped in his grief.\nC is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply making things clearer or easier to understand, but Heathcliff\u2019s emotional state is causing confusion and sorrow, not clarity.\nD is incorrect because \"sustain\" suggests something that supports or keeps something going, but Heathcliff\u2019s grief is not helping him move forward\u2014it is hindering his ability to let go."}
