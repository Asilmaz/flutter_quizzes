{"introduction": "The following text is from The Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle. Dr. Watson reflects on the mysterious events surrounding Sir Charles Baskerville's death.", "text": "Dr. Watson stood at the edge of the moor, the wind howling around him as he thought about the strange circumstances of Sir Charles\u2019s death. The footprints, the eerie howls in the night, and the stories of a phantom hound all pointed to something unnatural, but Watson was not so easily convinced. He knew that his task was not just to uncover the truth of Sir Charles\u2019s death but also to __________ the mystery with solid evidence that would silence all rumors and accusations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "obscure", "B": "unravel", "C": "dismiss", "D": "perpetuate", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Unravel\nChoice C, \"unravel,\" is the best answer because it logically fits the context of Dr. Watson's task. To \"unravel\" the mystery implies a careful process of uncovering the truth and resolving the confusion surrounding Sir Charles\u2019s death.\nA is incorrect because \"obscure\" means to make something unclear, which would go against Watson's goal of clarifying the mystery.\nB is incorrect because \"dismiss\" suggests disregarding the mystery or not taking it seriously, whereas Watson is determined to uncover the truth.\nD is incorrect because \"perpetuate\" means to continue or prolong something, which contradicts Watson\u2019s goal of solving the mystery and bringing closure."}
