{"introduction": "The following text is from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. Ishmael reflects on the nature of Captain Ahab\u2019s obsession with the white whale.", "text": "Ishmael sat quietly in the mess hall, watching Captain Ahab as he paced back and forth on the deck. Ahab\u2019s single-minded focus on hunting the white whale had consumed him, and it was clear to Ishmael that this obsession was slowly taking its toll on the captain. Ahab no longer seemed like the man he had been at the beginning of the voyage\u2014he was now driven by something darker. Ishmael couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether Ahab\u2019s obsession had __________ him, changing him into a person consumed by vengeance rather than reason.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "clarified", "B": "freed", "C": "transformed", "D": "distracted", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Transformed\nChoice C, \"transformed,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects the dramatic change in Ahab\u2019s character. The passage suggests that Ahab\u2019s obsession with the white whale has altered his personality, turning him from a reasonable person into someone consumed by vengeance.\nA is incorrect because \"clarified\" would suggest that Ahab's obsession made him clearer or more understandable, but the passage indicates that it actually distorts his personality.\nB is incorrect because \"freed\" would imply liberation or release, which is the opposite of what Ahab experiences. His obsession traps him in a cycle of vengeance.\nD is incorrect because \"distracted\" suggests a lack of focus, but the passage shows that Ahab\u2019s obsession actually sharpens his focus on revenge, not making him less attentive."}
