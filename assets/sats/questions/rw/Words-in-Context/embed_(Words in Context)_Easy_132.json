Jane reflects on her changing view of Mr. Rochester after learning about his past.", "text": "Jane sat by the window, her thoughts on Mr. Rochester. The more she learned about his past, the more complicated her feelings became. At first, she had seen him as a figure of strength and authority, but now she realized that his past actions were far from simple. His marriage to Bertha Mason, though a part of his history, had left scars on him that she could now see. Jane understood that her opinion of Mr. Rochester had begun to __________, as she moved from admiration to a more conflicted understanding of his character.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "complicate", "B": "intensify", "C": "clarify", "D": "diminish", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Complicate\nChoice C, \"complicate,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Jane\u2019s view of Mr. Rochester has become more complex and difficult to understand after learning about his past. The passage suggests that her feelings are no longer straightforward, but instead, filled with conflicting emotions.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would imply that her feelings have become simpler or easier to understand, but the passage shows that her emotions have grown more complicated.\nB is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that Jane's feelings for Mr. Rochester are becoming stronger, but the passage suggests that her emotions are becoming more conflicted, not just stronger.\nD is incorrect because \"diminish\" would suggest that her feelings for Mr. Rochester are fading, but the passage implies that her emotions are evolving into something more complex, not less."}
