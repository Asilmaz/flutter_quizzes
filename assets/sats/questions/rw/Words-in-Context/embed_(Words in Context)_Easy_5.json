{"introduction": "The following text is from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle. Dr. Watson reflects on the nature of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s reasoning.", "text": "Sherlock Holmes sat in his chair, his fingers steepled together as he listened intently to the details of the case. His mind was already racing through possibilities, sorting through clues and inconsistencies that others might have missed. Watson often marveled at how Holmes could make deductions with such precision, seemingly pulling answers out of thin air. \"You are sure of your conclusions, Holmes?\" Watson asked. Holmes smiled slightly and replied, \"I do not draw conclusions from guesses, Watson. I ______ the facts and follow where they lead.\"", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "evaluate", "B": "ignore", "C": "invent", "D": "speculate", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Evaluate\nChoice A, \"evaluate,\" is the best answer because it aligns with Holmes\u2019s method of reasoning, which is based on a careful, methodical examination of facts. The phrase \"I evaluate the facts\" suggests that Holmes\u2019s conclusions are grounded in analysis, not hunches or guesses.\nB is incorrect because \"ignore\" suggests that Holmes disregards important facts, which contradicts his usual approach of solving cases based on meticulous observation and analysis.\nC is incorrect because \"invent\" implies creating information out of nothing, which is the opposite of Holmes\u2019s methodical deduction process.\nD is incorrect because \"speculate\" means forming a theory without sufficient evidence, which doesn\u2019t match Holmes\u2019s logical and evidence-based reasoning process."}
