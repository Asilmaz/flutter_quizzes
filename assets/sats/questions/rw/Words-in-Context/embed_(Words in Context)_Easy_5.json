	"introduction": "The following text is from a critical essay on modern architecture, describing the reception of a controversial design for a new museum.",
	"text": "Critics claimed that the structureâ€™s sweeping lines and open spaces were meant to shock the public rather than to __________ a sense of continuity with the surrounding historic district.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "cultivate",
	"B": "disregard",
	"C": "subvert",
	"D": "foretell",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A, \"cultivate,\" implies carefully fostering something (in this case, continuity with older architecture). The text contrasts shocking design with creating a sense of harmony, so \"cultivate\" fits. \"Subvert,\" \"disregard,\" or \"foretell\" do not capture the notion of nurturing harmony."
