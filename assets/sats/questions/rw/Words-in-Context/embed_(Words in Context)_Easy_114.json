{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotional state after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly observed Catherine from a distance, noting the subtle shift in her behavior since her marriage to Edgar. Catherine had once been wild and free, but now, she seemed restless, her gaze often wandering to the moors. Though she had married Edgar for his wealth and status, Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s heart remained with Heathcliff. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff had begun to __________ her, leaving her unable to find peace in her marriage or in her own mind.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "define", "B": "torment", "C": "liberate", "D": "validate", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Torment\nChoice A, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it captures how Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings for Heathcliff are causing her emotional distress and inner conflict. The passage suggests that these feelings are preventing her from finding peace, both in her marriage and within herself.\nB is incorrect because \"define\" suggests that Catherine\u2019s feelings are giving her clarity or direction, but the passage indicates that they are causing her pain and unrest.\nC is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff are freeing her from something, but the passage shows that they are causing emotional turmoil, not freedom.\nD is incorrect because \"validate\" would imply that Catherine's feelings for Heathcliff are somehow justified or supported, but the passage emphasizes her internal conflict, not validation."}
