{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s feelings after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly watched Catherine from the doorway, her heart heavy with sympathy. Catherine had always been a force of nature, wild and free, but since her marriage to Edgar Linton, she had become subdued. Catherine\u2019s love for Heathcliff still lingered, but her desire for social status had led her to marry Edgar instead. Nelly could see the toll this conflict was taking on Catherine, leaving her feeling trapped between duty and passion. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s emotional state seemed to __________ her, preventing her from truly being at peace, no matter how much she tried to fit into her new life.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "torment", "C": "empower", "D": "stabilize", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Torment\nChoice C, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it captures the emotional suffering Catherine experiences due to her inner conflict between her love for Heathcliff and her commitment to Edgar. The passage emphasizes that this emotional turmoil is causing Catherine great distress.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" implies freedom or release, but Catherine\u2019s emotional struggle is actually trapping her, not freeing her.\nB is incorrect because \"empower\" suggests strength or control, but Catherine\u2019s conflict is weakening her, not empowering her.\nD is incorrect because \"stabilize\" would imply that Catherine\u2019s emotions are becoming more balanced, which contradicts the passage\u2019s portrayal of her emotional distress and unrest."}
