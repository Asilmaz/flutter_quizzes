{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on Mr. Darcy\u2019s unexpected proposal and her own feelings toward him.", "text": "Elizabeth sat by the fire, reading Mr. Darcy's letter for the third time. The words were still a shock to her; she had never expected him to confess such feelings, particularly after his earlier remarks about her family. Yet, as she re-read his letter, Elizabeth realized that her emotions were no longer as simple as they had been before. Her initial disdain had now begun to __________, replaced by a more complicated understanding of his character and his motivations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "intensify", "B": "subside", "C": "justify", "D": "ignore", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Subside\nChoice B, \"subside,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects how Elizabeth's initial feelings of anger and disdain toward Mr. Darcy are gradually fading as she gains a more nuanced understanding of him. The passage shows her emotions softening, leading to a more complex view of his character.\nA is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s negative feelings toward Mr. Darcy are growing stronger, which contradicts the passage indicating that her emotions are softening.\nC is incorrect because \"justify\" implies that Elizabeth is rationalizing Mr. Darcy\u2019s actions, but the passage focuses on her emotional shift, not on finding reasons to excuse him.\nD is incorrect because \"ignore\" suggests that Elizabeth would disregard Mr. Darcy's feelings, but the passage shows her becoming more open to understanding him."}
