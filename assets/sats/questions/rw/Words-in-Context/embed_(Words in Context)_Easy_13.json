	"introduction": "The following text is from a sociological article examining the impact of cultural narratives on personal identity.",
	"text": "Such stories often become so ingrained in a group’s collective consciousness that questioning them can provoke __________, as if the narrative were beyond critique.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "dissonance",
	"B": "reverence",
	"C": "umbrage",
	"D": "curiosity",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C, \"umbrage,\" means offense or annoyance, fitting the idea that people react negatively when foundational narratives are challenged. \"Dissonance\" suggests conflict or clash but doesn’t capture personal offense; \"reverence\" and \"curiosity\" don’t match the notion of taking offense."
