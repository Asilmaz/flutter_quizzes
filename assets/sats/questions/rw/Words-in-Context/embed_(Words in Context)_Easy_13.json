{"introduction": "The following text is from The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. Tom Joad reflects on his place in the world and the hardships his family faces.", "text": "Tom stood on the edge of the dusty road, looking out at the horizon. The land stretched out before him, barren and cracked from the drought. He had always been taught that the land was something to be worked, something to be fought for, but now it seemed to be turning against him. As he thought about his family's struggles, he realized that their survival depended not just on the land but on something greater\u2014a unity that was spreading among the people. This realization made him understand that his family's future would be shaped not by individual effort, but by a __________ of people fighting for a common cause.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "division", "B": "conflict", "C": "negotiation", "D": "cooperation", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Cooperation\nChoice C, \"cooperation,\" is the best answer because it logically completes the passage\u2019s theme of collective struggle. Tom Joad\u2019s realization is that the survival of his family, and others like them, depends on working together. The word \"cooperation\" fits this theme of unity and collective action.\nA is incorrect because \"division\" means separation or disunity, which contradicts the passage\u2019s message about working together.\nB is incorrect because \"conflict\" suggests struggle or opposition, which contrasts with the idea of people uniting for a common cause.\nD is incorrect because \"negotiation\" refers to discussions aimed at reaching an agreement, which is not the central idea of unity in the passage."}
