	"introduction": "The following text is from a literary analysis of a French novel set in post-war Paris, focusing on the protagonist’s disillusionment.",
	"text": "Marie’s letters to her distant family revealed a profound __________ that her once-beloved city was no longer capable of inspiring true hope, only weariness.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "conviction",
	"B": "concession",
	"C": "resentment",
	"D": "discovery",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A, \"conviction,\" indicates a strongly held belief that Paris had lost its capacity to evoke hope. The text focuses on her certain, deep-seated view. \"Concession\" means a reluctant acknowledgment, \"resentment\" focuses on anger, and \"discovery\" implies newly found information, which isn’t the point here."
