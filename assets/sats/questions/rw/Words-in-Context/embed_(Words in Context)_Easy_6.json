{"introduction": "The following text is from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. Holden Caulfield reflects on his feelings about his little sister, Phoebe.", "text": "Holden sat on the bed, looking at his sister as she played. Despite his usual cynicism and disdain for the world around him, Phoebe had a way of making him feel calmer, more at ease. He couldn\u2019t quite explain why, but her innocence and joy in the little things seemed to offer him a brief respite from his often troubled thoughts. As he observed her, he realized that, in contrast to his own emotional struggles, Phoebe was completely __________ in her outlook on life. She had none of the jadedness or doubt that he carried with him.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "indifferent", "B": "burdened", "C": "thoughtful", "D": "carefree", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Carefree\nChoice C, \"carefree,\" is the best answer because it most accurately reflects the contrast between Holden\u2019s emotional struggles and Phoebe\u2019s joyful, untroubled nature. The passage suggests that Phoebe\u2019s innocence and happiness provide Holden with a sense of relief, highlighting her carefree outlook on life.\nA is incorrect because \"indifferent\" means showing a lack of concern or interest, which doesn't match the context of Phoebe\u2019s joyful and active engagement with life.\nB is incorrect because \"burdened\" would imply that Phoebe has heavy emotional struggles, which contradicts the portrayal of her as an innocent, happy child.\nD is incorrect because \"thoughtful\" implies deep consideration or reflection, which doesn\u2019t align with the description of Phoebe as carefree and untroubled."}
