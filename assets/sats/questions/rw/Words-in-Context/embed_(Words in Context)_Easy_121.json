{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Heathcliff\u2019s emotional state after Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s death.", "text": "Nelly sat quietly by the fire, watching Heathcliff as he paced back and forth. Since Catherine's death, he had become a shadow of the man he once was. The fierce passion he had once shown was now replaced by a haunting emptiness. Heathcliff\u2019s emotions seemed to have turned inward, consumed by grief and longing. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s death had begun to __________ him, deepening his sorrow and causing him to withdraw further into himself, unable to escape the memories of her.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "torment", "C": "fortify", "D": "empower", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Torment\nChoice A, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine's death has deeply affected Heathcliff, causing him great emotional pain and inner suffering. The passage suggests that his feelings of grief are causing him to suffer mentally and emotionally.\nB is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests freedom, but Heathcliff is clearly trapped in his grief and memories, not freed from them.\nC is incorrect because \"fortify\" implies that Heathcliff is becoming stronger or more resilient, but the passage indicates that he is weakened and consumed by sorrow, not strengthened.\nD is incorrect because \"empower\" would imply that Heathcliff\u2019s grief is giving him strength or control, but the passage shows that it is having the opposite effect, diminishing him emotionally."}
