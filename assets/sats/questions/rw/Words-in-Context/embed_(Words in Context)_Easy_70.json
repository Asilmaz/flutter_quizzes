{"introduction": "The following text is from Dracula by Bram Stoker. Jonathan Harker reflects on his increasing sense of unease regarding Count Dracula\u2019s behavior.", "text": "Jonathan sat in the dimly lit room, trying to make sense of the strange events that had been unfolding since his arrival at Dracula\u2019s castle. The Count had been courteous but distant, and there was something unnerving about his gaze. At first, Jonathan had thought it was merely his imagination, but now he was sure there was more to it. Dracula\u2019s behavior seemed to __________ him, making Jonathan feel as though he were being watched, even when he wasn\u2019t looking directly at the Count.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "comfort", "B": "captivate", "C": "intimidate", "D": "alienate", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Intimidate\nChoice B, \"intimidate,\" is the best answer because it captures the sense of fear and unease Jonathan experiences around Dracula. The passage describes how Dracula\u2019s behavior has a disturbing effect on Jonathan, causing him to feel as if he is being watched.\nA is incorrect because \"comfort\" implies a feeling of reassurance or calm, which contradicts Jonathan\u2019s growing unease and discomfort around Dracula.\nC is incorrect because \"captivate\" suggests fascination or attraction, but the text emphasizes Jonathan\u2019s fear, not admiration or charm.\nD is incorrect because \"alienate\" would suggest a feeling of separation or distance, but the passage highlights Jonathan\u2019s sense of being watched, not necessarily distanced from Dracula."}
