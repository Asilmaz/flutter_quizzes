{"introduction": "The following text is from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Jane reflects on her evolving feelings for Mr. Rochester as their relationship deepens.", "text": "Jane sat in the quiet of the drawing room, her thoughts turning to Mr. Rochester. Over the past few weeks, she had come to know him in a way she never expected. Though she had initially seen him as distant and difficult, she now understood the complexity behind his harsh exterior. As their conversations grew more intimate, Jane realized that her admiration for him had evolved into something stronger\u2014something she couldn\u2019t easily define. She felt that her feelings for Mr. Rochester had begun to __________, shifting from mere respect to an undeniable emotional connection.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "fluctuate", "B": "restrain", "C": "confuse", "D": "deepen", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Deepen\nChoice B, \"deepen,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects the progression of Jane's feelings for Mr. Rochester. As the text suggests, her emotions are no longer just based on admiration, but have grown into something stronger and more profound.\nA is incorrect because \"fluctuate\" suggests instability or change, which contradicts the idea of her feelings becoming more settled and stronger over time.\nC is incorrect because \"confuse\" implies that her feelings are unclear or uncertain, but the passage indicates that her feelings are becoming clearer, not more confused.\nD is incorrect because \"restrain\" suggests limiting or holding back, which doesn't match the idea of Jane\u2019s growing emotional connection with Mr. Rochester."}
