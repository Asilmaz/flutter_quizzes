{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s inner conflict regarding her love for Heathcliff.", "text": "Nelly stood quietly in the corner of the room, watching Catherine as she paced back and forth, her mind clearly torn. She had always loved Heathcliff, but her desire for social status and stability had led her to marry Edgar Linton instead. Catherine\u2019s emotions were not simple\u2014they were filled with passion, but also with anger and regret. Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff had become an obsession, one that seemed to __________ her, making it impossible for her to find peace, even when she was physically apart from him.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "obscure", "B": "liberate", "C": "consume", "D": "elevate", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Consume\nChoice C, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff have overtaken her entire emotional state. The passage suggests that her passion for him is all-encompassing, leaving her with little room for anything else, including peace.\nA is incorrect because \"obscure\" would suggest that her feelings hide or cloud her understanding, but the passage emphasizes the overwhelming nature of her obsession, not confusion.\nB is incorrect because \"liberate\" implies freedom, but Catherine\u2019s obsession with Heathcliff keeps her trapped in emotional turmoil, not free.\nD is incorrect because \"elevate\" would suggest that her obsession improves or raises her emotional state, but instead, it creates inner conflict and torment."}
