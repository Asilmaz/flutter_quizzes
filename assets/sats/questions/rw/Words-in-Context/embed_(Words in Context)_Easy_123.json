{"introduction": "The following text is from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Jane reflects on her changing feelings toward Mr. Rochester after learning the truth about his past.", "text": "Jane stood by the window, her thoughts swirling as she tried to make sense of everything Mr. Rochester had told her. His confession had been shocking, and Jane felt a mixture of sympathy and betrayal. She had always admired him, but now that she knew the full truth, her emotions were no longer as straightforward. She realized that her perception of him had begun to __________, and she struggled to reconcile her admiration for his character with the darker reality of his past.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "complicate", "B": "distort", "C": "clarify", "D": "justify", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Complicate\nChoice C, \"complicate,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Jane\u2019s feelings toward Mr. Rochester have become more complex and difficult to navigate after learning about his past. The passage suggests that her emotions are no longer simple, and she is struggling to reconcile her earlier admiration with the darker truths she now knows.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that Jane\u2019s emotions have become simpler or easier to understand, but the passage emphasizes that they have become more complicated, not clearer.\nB is incorrect because \"distort\" would imply that her feelings are becoming warped or inaccurate, but the passage does not suggest that Jane\u2019s feelings are being misled, only that they are more conflicted.\nD is incorrect because \"justify\" would imply that Jane is finding reasons to excuse Mr. Rochester\u2019s actions, but the passage suggests that her view is becoming more complex, not that she is justifying his behavior."}
