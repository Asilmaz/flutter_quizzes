{"introduction": "The following text is from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Victor Frankenstein reflects on the tragic consequences of his creation.", "text": "Victor sat in his study, his hands shaking as he thought about the creature he had brought to life. What had once seemed like an exciting and noble pursuit now felt like a terrible mistake. The creature, monstrous and alone, had caused havoc, and Victor knew that his refusal to take responsibility for it had only made things worse. As he reflected on his actions, Victor realized that his ambition had __________ the situation, leading to a tragic outcome that could have been avoided if he had considered the consequences more carefully.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "simplified", "B": "ignored", "C": "explained", "D": "worsened", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Worsened\nChoice A, \"worsened,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Victor\u2019s ambition and lack of responsibility only made the situation more dire. The passage suggests that instead of improving or solving the problem, his actions escalated the consequences and led to tragedy.\nB is incorrect because \"ignored\" would imply that Victor didn\u2019t acknowledge the situation, but the passage suggests that he was aware of the consequences but failed to act responsibly.\nC is incorrect because \"explained\" would suggest that Victor's actions clarified the situation, which is the opposite of what happened\u2014his actions led to greater harm.\nD is incorrect because \"simplified\" would imply that Victor\u2019s actions made things easier or more manageable, which doesn\u2019t fit with the passage\u2019s tone of increasing complexity and regret."}
