{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotional struggles after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly stood in the doorway, watching Catherine as she gazed out at the moors. Since her marriage to Edgar Linton, Catherine had become more withdrawn, her once vibrant energy replaced by a quiet sadness. She seemed torn between the life she had chosen and the love she still felt for Heathcliff. Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff continued to __________ her, preventing her from finding peace in her marriage and forcing her to live in constant emotional conflict.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "confuse", "C": "define", "D": "torment", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Torment\nChoice D, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects the emotional pain Catherine feels as she struggles between her love for Heathcliff and her duty to Edgar. The passage emphasizes how these conflicting feelings cause her great distress and prevent her from finding peace.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" implies freedom or release, but Catherine's emotions are trapping her in inner turmoil, not freeing her.\nB is incorrect because \"confuse\" suggests a lack of clarity, but the passage focuses more on the emotional pain and distress Catherine feels, rather than confusion.\nC is incorrect because \"define\" would imply that her feelings for Heathcliff give her a sense of purpose or clarity, but instead, they are causing her emotional conflict."}
