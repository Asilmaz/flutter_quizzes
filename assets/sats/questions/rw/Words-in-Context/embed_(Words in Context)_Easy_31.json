{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her feelings toward Mr. Darcy after his unexpected proposal.", "text": "Elizabeth sat alone in her room, trying to process the events of the afternoon. Mr. Darcy\u2019s proposal had taken her by surprise, and she was still struggling to understand the full extent of his feelings. Despite his eloquent words, she couldn\u2019t ignore the prideful way he had spoken about her family, and the condescension in his tone still stung. As she thought about his offer, she realized that his actions had only __________ her feelings, leaving her with more confusion than clarity.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "intensified", "B": "clarified", "C": "alleviated", "D": "justified", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Intensified\nChoice B, \"intensified,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Mr. Darcy\u2019s proposal only made Elizabeth\u2019s emotions more complex and heightened her confusion. His condescension made her reaction stronger, not clearer, intensifying her conflicting feelings toward him.\nA is incorrect because \"clarified\" would suggest that his proposal made things clearer, which contradicts the confusion Elizabeth feels.\nC is incorrect because \"alleviated\" means to lessen or ease, which is the opposite of what happened in this case. His words added to her distress rather than easing it.\nD is incorrect because \"justified\" would imply that Mr. Darcy\u2019s actions were reasonable, but Elizabeth\u2019s feelings are more focused on her growing dissatisfaction with his approach, not an understanding of it."}
