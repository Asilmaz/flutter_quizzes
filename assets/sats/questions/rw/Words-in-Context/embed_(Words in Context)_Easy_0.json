	"introduction": "The following text is adapted from a late nineteenth-century political essay by an unknown author, discussing the effects of changing economic policies on small communities.",
	"text": "The villagers recognized that the sudden drop in grain prices would __________ their fragile livelihood, forcing many of them to seek work elsewhere. No one was prepared for the ensuing hardships.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "mitigate",
	"B": "jeopardize",
	"C": "chronicle",
	"D": "ameliorate",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B, \"jeopardize,\" best fits the context of threatening or endangering the villagers’ livelihood. The text indicates that they’ll have to seek work elsewhere, suggesting harm to their current economic situation. \"Mitigate\" and \"ameliorate\" suggest improvement rather than harm, and \"chronicle\" means to record events."
