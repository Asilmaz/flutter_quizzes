{"introduction": "The following text is from The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton. The narrator describes Lily Bart, a young woman of high society in New York, as she faces a dilemma about her future.", "text": "Lily felt the chill of indecision as she looked at the letter in her hand. It was an invitation to a party where she might finally secure the match she had longed for, yet something held her back. Her heart wavered as she thought of the cost of success, the sacrifices she might have to make in order to climb the social ladder. Despite her aspirations, Lily had always been uneasy about the _______________ of her ambition, for it often seemed that every step forward required leaving something\u2014or someone\u2014behind.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "sincerity", "B": "limitations", "C": "depth", "D": "pitfalls", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Pitfalls\nChoice C, \"pitfalls,\" is the best answer because it most logically reflects the context of the text. \"Pitfalls\" means hidden dangers or difficulties, which fits the idea that Lily's ambition is fraught with challenges or sacrifices, as described in the sentence. The text suggests that success might come at a cost, which is often implied by the term \"pitfalls.\"\nA is incorrect because \"sincerity\" doesn\u2019t align with the context of the sentence. Lily's issue is not about honesty but about the challenges and costs of her ambition.\nB is incorrect because \"limitations\" would imply restrictions or boundaries, but the sentence discusses the risks or hazards she faces, not her limits.\nD is incorrect because \"depth\" refers to profoundness or complexity, which doesn\u2019t fit the context of her being wary about the consequences of her ambition."}
