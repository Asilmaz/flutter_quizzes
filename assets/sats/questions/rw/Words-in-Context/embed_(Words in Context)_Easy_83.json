{"introduction": "The following text is from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Jane reflects on her evolving feelings for Mr. Rochester after their intense conversation.", "text": "Jane sat in her room, her mind spinning with the conversation she had just had with Mr. Rochester. She had always admired him, but tonight, his words had shaken her deeply. He had spoken to her with a raw honesty that she had not expected, revealing parts of his life she could never have imagined. As Jane thought about it, she realized that her feelings for him were no longer simple admiration\u2014they had begun to __________, becoming more complex and full of contradictions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "simplify", "B": "fluctuate", "C": "diminish", "D": "intensify", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Intensify\nChoice A, \"intensify,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Jane\u2019s feelings for Mr. Rochester have grown stronger and more profound. The passage suggests that her emotions are becoming more complicated, which implies an increase in intensity.\nB is incorrect because \"fluctuate\" suggests inconsistency or change, but the passage implies a steady increase in the depth of her feelings.\nC is incorrect because \"diminish\" would imply that Jane\u2019s feelings are weakening, which contradicts the passage\u2019s theme of growing emotional complexity.\nD is incorrect because \"simplify\" suggests that her feelings are becoming clearer or easier to understand, but the passage describes them as becoming more complex, not simpler."}
