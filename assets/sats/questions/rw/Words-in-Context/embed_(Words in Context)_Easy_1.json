	"introduction": "The following text is from a historical analysis of Queen Margaret of Anjou’s court, describing her advisers’ influence and her struggle for authority.",
	"text": "Queen Margaret had surrounded herself with officials whose guidance often __________ her own royal vision, leaving her uncertain which path to pursue in matters of state.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "refuted",
	"B": "appealed to",
	"C": "superseded",
	"D": "obscured",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C, \"superseded,\" fits the idea that the officials’ counsel replaced or overshadowed the queen’s own vision, causing her uncertainty. \"Refuted\" suggests direct contradiction rather than replacement, while \"obscured\" and \"appealed to\" do not capture the sense that her vision was supplanted by theirs."
