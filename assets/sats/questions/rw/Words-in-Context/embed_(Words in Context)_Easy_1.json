{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet is reflecting on her sister Jane\u2019s relationship with Mr. Bingley.", "text": "Elizabeth could not help feeling a little disappointed. She had always hoped that Mr. Bingley would propose to Jane, and it seemed so certain that he would, given his attentions and kindness. But now that he had been gone for several weeks, with no word or sign of affection, Elizabeth began to wonder whether her sister had misjudged him. Perhaps Mr. Bingley had never been as serious as Jane had believed. As she thought of the matter, she realized that Jane had been entirely __________ in her expectations, placing all her hopes on the idea of Mr. Bingley\u2019s affection despite the lack of evidence to support it.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "diligent", "B": "mistaken", "C": "critical", "D": "naive", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Naive\nChoice C, \"naive,\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects Elizabeth\u2019s judgment of Jane's overly idealistic and uncritical expectations. The text suggests that Jane had placed too much hope in Mr. Bingley\u2019s attentions without any firm proof of his intentions, which is typical of a naive outlook.\nA is incorrect because \"diligent\" means showing careful and persistent work or effort, which doesn't fit the context. The issue isn't Jane's work ethic but her uncritical hope.\nB is incorrect because \"mistaken\" implies a wrong conclusion, but the focus is more on Jane\u2019s innocent belief, not simply an error.\nD is incorrect because \"critical\" would suggest a negative or judgmental attitude, which contrasts with the tone of the passage. Elizabeth is not criticizing Jane's expectations but rather recognizing them as naive."}
