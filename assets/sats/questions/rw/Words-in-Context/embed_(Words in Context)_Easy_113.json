The monster\u2019s appearance, its unnatural form, filled him with disgust, yet he could not help but feel a twinge of guilt. Victor realized that his ambition had begun to __________ him, leading him to ignore the potential consequences of his actions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "isolate", "C": "empower", "D": "cloud", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Cloud\nChoice D, \"cloud,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Victor\u2019s ambition has obscured his judgment and ability to see the full consequences of his actions.
