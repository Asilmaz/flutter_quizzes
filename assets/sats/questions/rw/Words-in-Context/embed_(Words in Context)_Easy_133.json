{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s feelings toward Heathcliff after his return.", "text": "Nelly sat in the corner, observing Catherine as she spoke of Heathcliff\u2019s return to Wuthering Heights. There was an intensity in her voice, a mixture of anger, passion, and something deeper. Catherine\u2019s emotions seemed to shift wildly, torn between her loyalty to Edgar and her unrelenting attachment to Heathcliff. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff had begun to __________ her, making it impossible for her to fully embrace her life with Edgar, no matter how hard she tried.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "confuse", "B": "empower", "C": "define", "D": "liberate", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Confuse\nChoice C, \"confuse,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s complex emotions for Heathcliff are causing her inner turmoil, leaving her uncertain about her feelings and preventing her from making a clear decision regarding her life with Edgar.\nA is incorrect because \"define\" would suggest that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff are giving her clarity, but instead, they are causing her emotional conflict.\nB is incorrect because \"empower\" would imply that Catherine's feelings are strengthening or motivating her, but the passage suggests that they are preventing her from moving forward.\nD is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests that her feelings for Heathcliff are freeing her, but the passage shows how those feelings are trapping her in confusion, not setting her free."}
