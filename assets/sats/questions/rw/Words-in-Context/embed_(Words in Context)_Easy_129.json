{"introduction": "The following text is from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Jane reflects on her growing feelings for Mr. Rochester after his emotional vulnerability is revealed.", "text": "Jane sat by the window, her thoughts drifting to Mr. Rochester. She had always admired his intelligence and strength, but his vulnerability had struck a different chord in her. His confession about his past had exposed a side of him that she had never expected, and Jane found herself torn between sympathy and confusion. She realized that her feelings for Mr. Rochester had begun to __________, as she saw him less as a distant, enigmatic figure and more as a man capable of deep emotion and pain.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "complicate", "B": "intensify", "C": "soften", "D": "clarify", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Soften\nChoice A, \"soften,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Jane\u2019s feelings toward Mr. Rochester are becoming less harsh and more empathetic. The passage suggests that his vulnerability has made her view him in a more compassionate light, softening her previous feelings of distance and caution.\nB is incorrect because \"intensify\" would suggest that Jane's feelings for Mr. Rochester are becoming stronger, but the passage focuses more on a shift in her emotional perspective, not on increasing intensity.\nC is incorrect because \"complicate\" would imply that her feelings are becoming more confusing or conflicted, but the passage shows that she is moving from a more distant judgment to a more sympathetic understanding.\nD is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that her feelings are becoming clearer in a logical sense, but the passage highlights a shift toward emotional understanding, not just clarity."}
