{"introduction": "The following text is from 1984 by George Orwell. Winston Smith reflects on the Party's manipulation of truth and history.", "text": "Winston sat at his desk in the drab, windowless room, his mind racing. He had been tasked with rewriting historical records to align with the Party\u2019s ever-changing narrative. The constant alteration of facts was disorienting, but Winston knew that this was the foundation of the Party's control over the people\u2014if they controlled the past, they could control the future. But as Winston pondered his work, he began to question the reality of his own existence. Was he truly free, or was he just another pawn in the Party's game? The more he thought, the more he realized how the Party had __________ the truth, not just to obscure it but to create a new, unquestionable reality for everyone.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "censored", "B": "reconstructed", "C": "distorted", "D": "exploited", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Distorted\nChoice D, \"distorted,\" is the best answer because it accurately captures the Party's method of manipulating truth. In 1984, the Party doesn\u2019t just obscure the truth; it actively warps or \"distorts\" reality to fit its own agenda, making any alternative version of the past impossible to verify.\nA is incorrect because \"censored\" would imply that information is suppressed or removed, whereas the Party\u2019s goal is to alter the truth, not just hide it.\nB is incorrect because \"reconstructed\" suggests rebuilding or reshaping the truth, which doesn\u2019t fully reflect the Party\u2019s approach of altering facts until they are entirely unrecognizable.\nC is incorrect because \"exploited\" means taking advantage of something, which doesn\u2019t quite fit the idea of actively changing the truth to control the narrative."}
