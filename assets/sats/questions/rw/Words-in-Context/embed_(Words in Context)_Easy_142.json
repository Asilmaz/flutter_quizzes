{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s feelings as she struggles with her love for Heathcliff and her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly stood in the doorway, watching Catherine as she sat by the fire, her eyes fixed on the flickering flames. Since her marriage, Catherine had seemed a different person, less wild and more controlled. But Nelly could still see the deep, restless longing in her eyes whenever she thought of Heathcliff. Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings for him seemed to __________ her, causing her to feel torn between two worlds\u2014one with Edgar, and one with the man she truly loved.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "torment", "B": "empower", "C": "liberate", "D": "define", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Torment\nChoice A, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine's unresolved feelings for Heathcliff are causing her emotional suffering. The passage suggests that these feelings are preventing her from finding peace, both with Edgar and within herself.\nB is incorrect because \"empower\" would imply that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff are giving her strength or control, but the passage shows that these feelings are instead causing emotional pain.\nC is incorrect because \"liberate\" would suggest that her feelings for Heathcliff are freeing her in some way, but the passage indicates that they are trapping her in inner conflict.\nD is incorrect because \"define\" would suggest that Catherine's feelings for Heathcliff are giving her clarity or purpose, but instead, they are a source of torment and confusion."}
