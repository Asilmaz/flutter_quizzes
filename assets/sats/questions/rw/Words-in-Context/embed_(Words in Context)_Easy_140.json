{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Heathcliff\u2019s behavior after Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s death.", "text": "Nelly watched Heathcliff from a distance, noting the profound change that had come over him since Catherine\u2019s death. He had been a man of intense passion, but now, his grief seemed to have drained him of all vitality. He moved like a shadow through the halls of Wuthering Heights, speaking little and looking even less. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s death had begun to __________ him, turning his passionate spirit into something dark and haunted.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "clarify", "B": "empower", "C": "liberate", "D": "consume", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Consume\nChoice C, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Heathcliff\u2019s grief is overwhelming him emotionally and mentally. The passage suggests that Catherine\u2019s death has taken over his life, leaving him trapped in sorrow and despair.\nA is incorrect because \"clarify\" would suggest that Heathcliff\u2019s grief is helping him understand or gain clarity, but the passage shows how it has made him more lost and disconnected.\nB is incorrect because \"empower\" would imply that Heathcliff's grief is giving him strength or motivation, but the passage indicates that it is instead weakening him and leaving him emotionally drained.\nD is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests that grief is freeing Heathcliff from something, but the passage shows how it is trapping him in a cycle of sadness and loss, not liberating him."}
