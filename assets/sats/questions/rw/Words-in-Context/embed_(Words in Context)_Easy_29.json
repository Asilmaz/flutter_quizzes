{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on the extravagance of Gatsby\u2019s parties and the people who attend them.", "text": "Nick looked around at the dazzling guests, their laughter filling the air as they drank and danced in Gatsby\u2019s grand mansion. The entire scene was one of opulence and excess\u2014everything designed to impress and dazzle. Yet, despite the wealth and glamour, Nick felt an emptiness beneath the surface. The guests came and went, indulging in fleeting pleasures, but there was no real connection or meaning in their interactions. It was as though they were all merely __________, lost in their pursuit of status and superficial enjoyment, without any true sense of purpose.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "wanderers", "B": "spectators", "C": "dreamers", "D": "strangers", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Wanderers\nChoice A, \"wanderers,\" is the best answer because it reflects the emptiness Nick feels about the guests. They are described as moving through Gatsby\u2019s world without real connection, drifting aimlessly through the superficial pleasures of the party. \"Wanderers\" captures the sense of directionlessness.\nB is incorrect because \"spectators\" suggests passive observers, but the guests are actively participating in the party, even if it lacks meaning.\nC is incorrect because \"dreamers\" implies a sense of hope or aspiration, which contrasts with the superficial nature of the guests\u2019 behavior.\nD is incorrect because \"strangers\" refers to unfamiliarity, which doesn\u2019t fully capture the sense of emptiness or lack of purpose in the guests\u2019 actions."}
