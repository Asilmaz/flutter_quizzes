{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw's emotional state after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly watched Catherine closely, noticing the subtle changes in her behavior. Since her marriage to Edgar, Catherine had been restless, unable to settle into the life she had chosen. She had once been a wild spirit, unrestrained and passionate, but now there was an air of restraint about her. Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s love for Heathcliff still lingered beneath the surface, though she had married Edgar for his wealth and status. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s conflicting emotions seemed to __________ her, pulling her in two directions and making her increasingly unhappy.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "stabilize", "B": "torment", "C": "liberate", "D": "motivate", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Torment\nChoice C, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it captures the emotional pain and inner conflict Catherine experiences as she struggles between her love for Heathcliff and her commitment to Edgar. The passage suggests that Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings are causing her distress and suffering.\nA is incorrect because \"stabilize\" would suggest that Catherine\u2019s emotions are becoming more balanced or calm, but the passage indicates she is becoming more disturbed and conflicted.\nB is incorrect because \"liberate\" would suggest that Catherine's emotions are freeing her, but instead, they are causing her pain and unrest.\nD is incorrect because \"motivate\" implies that her emotions drive her toward positive action, while the passage focuses on her suffering, not her motivation."}
