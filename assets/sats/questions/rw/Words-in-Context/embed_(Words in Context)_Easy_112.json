The passage highlights that her feelings are no longer straightforward; they have become conflicted and difficult to navigate.\nA is incorrect because \"intensify\" would imply that Jane's emotions are growing stronger, but the passage suggests that her emotions are becoming more difficult and entangled, not necessarily stronger.\nC is incorrect because \"clarify\" suggests that the truth has made Jane\u2019s feelings clearer, but in fact, her emotions have become more conflicted.\nD is incorrect because \"justify\" implies that Jane is rationalizing or excusing Mr. Rochester's actions, but the passage shows that her feelings are becoming more complex and uncertain."}
