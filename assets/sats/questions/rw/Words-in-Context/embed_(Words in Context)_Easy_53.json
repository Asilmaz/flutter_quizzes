{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on the enigmatic nature of Jay Gatsby.", "text": "Nick sat in his small apartment, his mind still filled with images of Gatsby\u2019s lavish parties and mysterious demeanor. He had spent months trying to understand the man who seemed to possess everything yet revealed so little about himself. Gatsby's charm and wealth had been a magnet for many, but Nick couldn\u2019t help feeling that there was something elusive about him\u2014something that wasn\u2019t visible on the surface. As Nick thought about his interactions with Gatsby, he began to feel that the man\u2019s life had been shaped by a singular obsession, one that seemed to __________ him, making him both magnetic and tragic in equal measure.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "define", "B": "complicate", "C": "deter", "D": "consume", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Consume\nChoice C, \"consume,\" is the best answer because it conveys that Gatsby\u2019s obsession has overtaken every aspect of his life, shaping his character and actions to the point of self-destruction. The passage suggests that Gatsby's focus on one goal has driven him to a tragic end, making \"consume\" the most fitting word.\nA is incorrect because \"define\" would suggest that Gatsby\u2019s obsession has simply shaped his identity in a clear and controlled manner, but the text indicates a more overpowering and destructive force.\nB is incorrect because \"complicate\" implies a complexity that doesn\u2019t fully convey the all-consuming nature of Gatsby's obsession, which the passage describes as driving him beyond control.\nD is incorrect because \"deter\" implies prevention or discouragement, which is not the case. Gatsby\u2019s obsession doesn\u2019t hold him back; it propels him forward, despite its tragic consequences."}
