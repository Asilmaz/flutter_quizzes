{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotions toward Heathcliff.", "text": "Nelly watched Catherine and Heathcliff from a distance, noting the complex relationship they shared. Catherine had always been fiercely attached to Heathcliff, but her love for him was mixed with anger, pride, and resentment. She had often spoken of him with great passion, yet there was an underlying bitterness in her words. Nelly had seen how this emotional conflict affected both of them, making their bond one of both __________ and desire, constantly pulling them toward each other even as it drove them apart.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "indifference", "B": "affection", "C": "hatred", "D": "jealousy", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Affection\nChoice C, \"affection,\" is the best answer because it reflects the deep love Catherine feels for Heathcliff despite the negative emotions she also experiences. The passage highlights the passionate yet conflicted nature of their relationship, where love (affection) coexists with other intense emotions.\nA is incorrect because \"indifference\" would imply a lack of emotional involvement, which contradicts the strong emotions Catherine has for Heathcliff.\nB is incorrect because \"hatred\" focuses on negative feelings, but the passage points out that Catherine's feelings are complex, including both love and bitterness, not just hatred.\nD is incorrect because \"jealousy\" might be part of their emotions, but it does not fully capture the intense love and attachment described in the passage, which is best encapsulated by \"affection.\""}
