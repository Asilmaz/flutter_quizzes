{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s changing feelings after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly stood by the window, watching Catherine as she walked through the garden, her face clouded with a mixture of emotions. Catherine had always been passionate and headstrong, but since her marriage to Edgar Linton, she had become more reserved and conflicted. Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s love for Heathcliff had never truly faded, and that her marriage had only complicated things further. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff seemed to __________ her, pulling her in a direction she could neither control nor escape from.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "sustain", "B": "complicate", "C": "free", "D": "strengthen", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Complicate\nChoice B, \"complicate,\" is the best answer because it captures the emotional turmoil Catherine is experiencing as her feelings for Heathcliff conflict with her marriage to Edgar.
