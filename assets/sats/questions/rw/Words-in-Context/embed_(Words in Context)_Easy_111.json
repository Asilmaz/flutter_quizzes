{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotional state as she grows older.", "text": "Nelly watched Catherine from the doorway, observing the way her mood fluctuated from day to day. Catherine had always been a passionate and headstrong woman, but now, in her later years, there was a heaviness about her, a sense of deep dissatisfaction that seemed to affect her every action. Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings for Heathcliff had begun to __________ her, causing her both physical and emotional distress as she struggled to reconcile her desires with the reality of her life.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "haunt", "B": "define", "C": "liberate", "D": "obscure", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Haunt\nChoice B, \"haunt,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine's unresolved feelings for Heathcliff continue to affect her long after the initial events. The passage suggests that these lingering emotions are tormenting her, preventing her from finding peace and contributing to her distress.\nA is incorrect because \"define\" would imply that Catherine's feelings are shaping or giving clarity to her life, but instead, they are causing her emotional turmoil.\nC is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests freedom, whereas Catherine\u2019s emotions are trapping her in a cycle of dissatisfaction and emotional pain.\nD is incorrect because \"obscure\" suggests that her feelings are making things unclear, but \"haunt\" better captures the ongoing emotional burden Catherine carries from her unrequited love."}
