{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on the relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff.", "text": "Nelly walked slowly across the moors, her mind filled with thoughts of Catherine and Heathcliff. The two of them had always been inseparable, bound by a love that was as fierce as it was destructive. Despite their closeness, Catherine had married Edgar Linton, leaving Heathcliff heartbroken and vengeful. Nelly could see that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff had never truly faded, and she realized that their love had come to __________ her, making it impossible for either of them to find peace or happiness.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "isolate", "B": "liberate", "C": "define", "D": "haunt", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Haunt\nChoice A, \"haunt,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s and Heathcliff\u2019s love for each other continues to linger and trouble them long after they have been apart. The passage suggests that this love is something that follows them, affecting their emotional state and preventing them from finding peace.\nB is incorrect because \"liberate\" implies freedom, whereas their love is shown as something that traps and disturbs them, not liberates them.\nC is incorrect because \"define\" implies that their love gives them a clear sense of identity, but the passage emphasizes their inner conflict, not clarity.\nD is incorrect because \"isolate\" would suggest that their love keeps them apart, which is not the case. Their emotional bond is deeply entangled, not isolating them physically."}
