{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw's emotional state after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly watched Catherine as she stood by the window, her gaze lost in the vast expanse of the moors. Since her marriage to Edgar, Catherine had become more distant, as if something inside her had withered. She had once been wild, full of life, but now she seemed to be trapped between two worlds. Her love for Heathcliff still lingered, but Catherine could not bring herself to admit it. Nelly realized that Catherine\u2019s unresolved feelings for Heathcliff had begun to __________ her, causing her pain and confusion as she struggled to accept her life with Edgar.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "torment", "C": "define", "D": "strengthen", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Torment\nChoice C, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects the emotional suffering Catherine experiences due to her unresolved feelings for Heathcliff. The passage shows how Catherine\u2019s inability to reconcile her love for Heathcliff with her marriage to Edgar is causing her great pain and inner turmoil.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests that her feelings for Heathcliff are freeing her, but the passage indicates that they are instead causing her emotional distress and making her feel trapped.\nB is incorrect because \"define\" would imply that her feelings give her clarity or direction, but the passage suggests they are a source of suffering and confusion, not clarity.\nD is incorrect because \"strengthen\" would imply that Catherine\u2019s feelings are making her stronger or more determined, but the passage indicates that her feelings are weakening her emotionally, not strengthening her."}
