There was something unnatural about the Count\u2019s manner\u2014something that made Jonathan feel as though he were being watched, even when he wasn\u2019t looking. At first, Jonathan thought he was imagining things, but soon he began to realize that his growing unease wasn\u2019t just his imagination\u2014it was the result of Dracula\u2019s ability to __________ him, to make him feel both vulnerable and powerless in his presence.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "enlighten", "B": "comfort", "C": "energize", "D": "manipulate", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Manipulate\nChoice A, \"manipulate,\" is the best answer because it captures how Dracula exerts control over Jonathan, making him feel vulnerable and powerless. The passage suggests that Dracula is subtly influencing Jonathan\u2019s perception, which is characteristic of manipulation.\nB is incorrect because \"comfort\" would suggest that Dracula provides reassurance or calm, which is not the case here. Jonathan feels uneasy, not comforted.\nC is incorrect because \"energize\" implies giving Jonathan strength or vitality, but the passage indicates the opposite\u2014he feels powerless and uneasy.\nD is incorrect because \"enlighten\" implies gaining knowledge or insight, which is not what Jonathan is experiencing. His confusion and unease suggest the opposite of enlightenment."}
