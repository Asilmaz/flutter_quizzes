{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nick Carraway reflects on his relationship with the mysterious Jay Gatsby.", "text": "Nick felt an overwhelming sense of awe every time he entered Gatsby\u2019s mansion. The lavish parties, the grandeur, and the charm of the host himself all seemed to draw people in. Yet, as he spent more time with Gatsby, Nick began to see a different side of him\u2014one that seemed deeply lonely and burdened by the need to maintain an image of success. It became increasingly clear that Gatsby\u2019s glamorous lifestyle was merely a mask, one that concealed the __________ nature of his ambitions. Although others saw him as the embodiment of wealth and charm, Nick realized that there was much more lurking beneath the surface.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "shallow", "B": "deliberate", "C": "idealistic", "D": "tragic", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Tragic\nChoice D, \"tragic,\" is the best answer because it fits the context of Gatsby\u2019s life and aspirations. The passage suggests that Gatsby\u2019s wealth and charm mask deeper emotional struggles, leading Nick to realize that Gatsby\u2019s ambition is not just about superficial success but also about personal suffering and loneliness. \"Tragic\" captures the emotional weight of Gatsby\u2019s predicament.\nA is incorrect because \"shallow\" refers to something superficial or lacking depth, which doesn't fully capture the complex and sorrowful nature of Gatsby\u2019s ambitions.\nB is incorrect because \"deliberate\" implies intentionality or premeditation, but the text conveys more about Gatsby\u2019s inner struggles than his calculated actions.\nC is incorrect because \"idealistic\" suggests an overly optimistic or unrealistic view, which doesn\u2019t align with the melancholy reality of Gatsby\u2019s ambitions. Instead, his goals seem to come from a place of deep longing and personal sacrifice."}
