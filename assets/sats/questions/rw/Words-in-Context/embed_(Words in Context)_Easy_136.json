{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s emotional state after her marriage to Edgar Linton.", "text": "Nelly observed Catherine closely, noting the way her moods shifted with the passing of each day. Since her marriage, Catherine had seemed distant, as if torn between two lives. While she outwardly appeared content with Edgar, Nelly could see that her heart was still bound to Heathcliff. Catherine's feelings for him seemed to __________ her, making it impossible for her to fully embrace her life with Edgar despite the stability and comfort he offered.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "confuse", "C": "torment", "D": "define", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Torment\nChoice D, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects how Catherine\u2019s unresolved love for Heathcliff is causing her emotional pain and distress. The passage suggests that her feelings are overwhelming her and preventing her from finding peace with her marriage to Edgar.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" would imply that her feelings are freeing her from something, but instead, they are causing her inner conflict and emotional struggle.\nB is incorrect because \"confuse\" would suggest that Catherine's feelings are making things unclear, but the passage focuses more on the emotional pain and suffering caused by her feelings, not confusion.\nC is incorrect because \"define\" would imply that her feelings are giving her clarity or direction, but the passage shows that her emotions are preventing her from fully embracing her life with Edgar."}
