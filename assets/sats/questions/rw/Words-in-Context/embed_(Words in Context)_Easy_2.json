	"introduction": "The following text is from a philosophical treatise discussing the nature of virtuous action and personal responsibility.",
	"text": "To act morally is to be fully aware of the consequences of one’s decisions, rather than to remain __________ and assume no accountability for one’s effect on the world.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
	"A": "pensive",
	"B": "blameless",
	"C": "oblivious",
	"D": "methodical",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C, \"oblivious,\" works best in context. The sentence contrasts moral awareness with a lack of awareness. \"Pensive\" means thoughtful, which doesn’t fit the contrast. \"Blameless\" and \"methodical\" suggest different qualities than simple unawareness."
