{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. Nelly Dean reflects on Catherine Earnshaw\u2019s complicated feelings towards Heathcliff.", "text": "Nelly stood at the window, watching Catherine as she stared out at the moors. Catherine\u2019s love for Heathcliff had always been a turbulent, passionate force, but it was clear to Nelly that it had transformed into something darker over time. Catherine seemed torn between her love for Heathcliff and her desire for a more comfortable, stable life with Edgar Linton. As Nelly observed, it was evident that Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff had begun to __________ her, driving her to act in ways that hurt both herself and those around her.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "liberate", "B": "define", "C": "elevate", "D": "torment", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Torment\nChoice C, \"torment,\" is the best answer because it reflects the emotional pain Catherine is experiencing due to her unresolved feelings for Heathcliff. The passage indicates that Catherine\u2019s feelings have become a source of suffering, driving her to make decisions that harm herself and others.\nA is incorrect because \"liberate\" suggests freedom or release, but Catherine\u2019s feelings for Heathcliff are causing her to be trapped in emotional turmoil, not freeing her.\nB is incorrect because \"define\" implies that her feelings give her clarity or shape her identity in a positive way, but her emotions seem to be a source of inner conflict, not clarity.\nD is incorrect because \"elevate\" implies that her feelings are uplifting or improving her, but the passage shows how her attachment to Heathcliff is leading to distress and destructive behavior."}
