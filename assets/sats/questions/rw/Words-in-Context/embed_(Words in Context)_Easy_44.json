Jane reflects on her evolving relationship with Mr. Rochester.", "text": "As Jane walked through the gardens of Thornfield, her thoughts turned to Mr. Rochester. Over the past few months, she had come to know him in ways she hadn\u2019t anticipated. Initially, she had been wary of his dark and mysterious demeanor, but as their interactions grew more personal, she began to recognize a different side of him\u2014a side that revealed vulnerability beneath his stern exterior. She realized that her feelings for him were not just admiration but something deeper. Jane began to wonder whether her affection for him had __________ over time, moving beyond mere respect into something more profound.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?", "A": "deepened", "B": "fluctuated", "C": "diminished", "D": "evaporated", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Deepened\nChoice C, \"deepened,\" is the best answer because it fits the progression of Jane\u2019s feelings for Mr. Rochester. The passage indicates that Jane\u2019s feelings have evolved from mere respect into something stronger and more profound, which \"deepened\" captures perfectly.\nA is incorrect because \"diminished\" would imply that her feelings have lessened, which contradicts the passage\u2019s idea that her affection has grown.\nB is incorrect because \"fluctuated\" suggests inconsistency or change, whereas the passage implies a steady and increasing depth in her feelings.\nD is incorrect because \"evaporated\" would suggest that her feelings have disappeared, which does not fit the tone of the passage, where her feelings have only become stronger."}
