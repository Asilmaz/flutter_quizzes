{"introduction": "The following text is from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1866). Raskolnikov reflects on the crime he committed and the deep sense of guilt that has begun to weigh on him.", "text": "Raskolnikov paced his room, his mind clouded by guilt and regret. The justification he had once convinced himself of now seemed hollow, a feeble excuse to cover the darkness he felt growing within. He could still see the image of his victim\u2019s face, a haunting reminder that he could not escape. The crime he had committed had left a mark on his soul, one that he feared would never fade.", "question": "What does Raskolnikov\u2019s reflection suggest about his feelings toward his actions?", "A": "He feels a deep sense of guilt and regret, realizing he cannot escape his actions.", "B": "He feels completely justified in his actions and has no remorse.", "C": "He is indifferent to the crime and barely thinks about it.", "D": "He feels proud of his actions and considers them a necessary step.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Raskolnikov feels guilt and regret, showing that he is haunted by his actions and realizes he cannot escape the consequences.Choice A is incorrect because he no longer feels justified; he is filled with regret. Choice C is incorrect because Raskolnikov is far from indifferent; he is deeply affected. Choice D is incorrect because he does not feel pride; he is tormented by guilt."}
