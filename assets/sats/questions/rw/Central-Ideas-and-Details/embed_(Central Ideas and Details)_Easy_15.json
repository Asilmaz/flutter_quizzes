	"introduction": "Adapted from a cultural historian’s work on architectural influences in Central Asia.",
	"text": "Although once a caravanserai thrived here, today only arches remain. Nonetheless, the faint inscriptions carved into pillars reveal Persian calligraphy, hinting at longstanding trade connections and cultural exchange along the ancient Silk Road.",
	"question": "What does the passage suggest about the remains of the caravanserai?",

	"B": "They were recently renovated to revive old trade routes.",
	"C": "They bear inscriptions that indicate the influence of Persian culture.",
	"D": "They are fully intact and continue to function as a popular lodging site.",
	"correct": "C",
