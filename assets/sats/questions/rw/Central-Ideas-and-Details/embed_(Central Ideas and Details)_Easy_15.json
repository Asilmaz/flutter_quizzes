Victor Frankenstein reflects on his decision to create life and the consequences of his experiment.", "text": "How dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardor that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "A": "Victor believes that knowledge and ambition can lead to dangerous consequences.", "B": "Victor is determined to continue his experiments despite the challenges.", "C": "Victor regrets sacrificing his health and happiness for his scientific experiment.", "D": "Victor worries that his creation will not live up to his high expectations.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Victor reflects on the dangers of seeking knowledge and attempting to exceed natural limits, suggesting that ambition can lead to dire consequences.Choice A is incorrect because, while Victor mentions the sacrifices he made, his main concern is the danger of ambition rather than personal regret about his health.
