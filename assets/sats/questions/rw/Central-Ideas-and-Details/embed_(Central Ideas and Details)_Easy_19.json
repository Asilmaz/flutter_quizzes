{"introduction": "The following text is from A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens (1859). Dr. Manette, a former prisoner, has recently been released after years of imprisonment in the Bastille. He is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, who hopes to help him regain his sense of self.", "text": "In the submissive way of one long accustomed to confinement, he sat, with his hands clasped around his knees, looking silently at the ground. Lucie held his arm and spoke softly to him, but there was an emptiness in his gaze. The years had left him a shell of his former self, yet there was a flicker of recognition when he looked at her. Lucie knew it would be a slow process to help him rediscover his identity, but her heart was filled with hope.", "question": "According to the text, what is Lucie\u2019s attitude towards helping her father recover?", "A": "She is hopeful and determined to restore him.", "B": "She is doubtful that her father will ever fully recover.", "C": "She feels overwhelmed by the difficulty of the task.", "D": "She believes he is not interested in reconnecting with her.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "C is the best answer because the text describes Lucie\u2019s heart as \u201cfilled with hope\u201d as she plans to help her father, indicating she is both hopeful and determined to restore him.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Lucie feels overwhelmed; she is described as hopeful. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest doubt; Lucie is hopeful and believes in her father\u2019s potential recovery. Choice D is incorrect because there is no suggestion that Dr. Manette is disinterested in reconnecting; rather, there is a \u201cflicker of recognition\u201d in his gaze, which implies some level of connection."}
