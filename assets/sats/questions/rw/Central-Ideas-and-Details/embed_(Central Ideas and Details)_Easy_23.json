{"introduction": "The following text is from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens (1841). Mr. Sampson Brass is working in his dimly lit law office, absorbed in his daily tasks.", "text": "Mr. Brass sat in his office, hunched over his desk, his nose nearly touching the paper as he wrote in his cramped handwriting. The room was cluttered, papers stacked haphazardly, and a single dim lamp barely lit the space. When the door creaked open and his sister entered, he looked up with an irritated glance. Sampson Brass did not enjoy being interrupted, especially when deep in his work, as he prided himself on efficiency\u2014even if it was conducted in a rather chaotic environment.", "question": "Based on the text, how does Mr. Brass most likely feel about his work environment?", "A": "He is indifferent to his surroundings and focuses solely on his tasks.", "B": "He prefers to work in solitude and dislikes interruptions.", "C": "He values a well-lit and meticulously organized workspace.", "D": "He finds it distracting and unorganized.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Mr. Brass\u2019s irritation when his sister enters and his pride in his work indicate that he prefers to work without interruptions, even in a chaotic setting.Choice A is incorrect because, while the environment is described as cluttered, there is no indication that Mr. Brass finds it distracting. Choice C is incorrect because Mr. Brass\u2019s workspace is neither well-lit nor organized, and there\u2019s no suggestion he values such conditions. Choice D is incorrect because he is not entirely indifferent to his surroundings; he becomes irritated when interrupted, showing he cares about working undisturbed."}
