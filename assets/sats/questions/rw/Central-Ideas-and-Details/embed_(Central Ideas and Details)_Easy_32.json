{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet is about to enter a room where she knows Mr. Darcy will be present.", "text": "Elizabeth paused for a moment outside the door, her heart beating a little faster than usual. She reminded herself to remain composed and unaffected by his presence, though she was keenly aware of his eyes upon her whenever they were in the same room. She took a steadying breath and stepped inside, determined to behave with her usual ease and wit, even if it was meant to hide the tumultuous feelings she couldn\u2019t quite explain.", "question": "According to the text, what is true about Elizabeth\u2019s feelings as she enters the room?", "A": "She is confident that she will enjoy Mr. Darcy\u2019s company.", "B": "She feels conflicted about her emotions toward Mr. Darcy.", "C": "She is determined to avoid speaking to Mr. Darcy.", "D": "She is completely indifferent to Mr. Darcy\u2019s presence.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Elizabeth\u2019s tumultuous feelings and her need to remain composed suggest that she feels conflicted and uncertain about her emotions toward Mr. Darcy.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Elizabeth is confident or anticipates enjoying his company. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not imply she intends to avoid Mr. Darcy; rather, she plans to maintain composure in his presence. Choice D is incorrect because Elizabeth is far from indifferent; she is aware of his gaze and has unresolved feelings."}
