The weight of his family\u2019s expectations pressed down on him, and he wondered if he would ever truly escape.", "question": "What does Newland\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward his societal obligations?", "A": "He feels trapped by societal expectations but fears the consequences of breaking free.", "B": "He is completely content and embraces the expectations placed on him.", "C": "He resents his family and society and plans to rebel against them.", "D": "He feels indifferent to the expectations and continues without any inner conflict.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Newland feels stifled and trapped by societal expectations, yet he is aware that leaving these obligations would have consequences, suggesting an inner conflict between duty and desire for freedom.Choice A is incorrect because Newland is not content; he feels confined.
