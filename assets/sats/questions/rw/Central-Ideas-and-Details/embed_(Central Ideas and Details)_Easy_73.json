{"introduction": "The following text is from The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton (1920). Newland Archer reflects on the restrictive nature of his society and the expectations placed upon him.", "text": "Newland felt as if the life laid out before him was like a finely woven net, each thread carefully placed to limit his movements. The rigid customs, the unspoken rules, and the constant pressure to conform weighed heavily on him. He longed for something different, something that would allow him to break free from these suffocating expectations. Yet, he knew that his role, his place in this society, was almost impossible to escape without consequences.", "question": "What does Newland\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward society\u2019s expectations?", "A": "He feels trapped by society\u2019s expectations and yearns for freedom.", "B": "He admires the customs of society and willingly conforms to them.", "C": "He is content with the structure of society and feels no need for change.", "D": "He is indifferent to societal expectations and ignores them completely.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Newland feels the expectations of society like a finely woven net that restricts him, and he longs for something different, indicating a desire for freedom from societal constraints.Choice A is incorrect because Newland is not content; he feels weighed down by society\u2019s customs. Choice C is incorrect because he does not admire the customs or willingly conform; he feels restricted by them. Choice D is incorrect because Newland is not indifferent; he is deeply aware of and troubled by society\u2019s expectations."}
