{"introduction": "The following text is from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain (1876). Tom Sawyer, tasked with painting a long fence, considers how to make the best of the situation.", "text": "Tom looked at the long fence before him with a sigh. The idea of spending his Saturday painting seemed unbearable, but then an idea struck him. With a mischievous grin, he picked up the brush and began to paint with exaggerated enthusiasm, as if it were the most enjoyable task in the world. Soon enough, other boys passing by stopped to watch, curious about what could make fence-painting so enjoyable. Tom sensed his plan was working, and he held back a smile as the boys grew eager to try it themselves.", "question": "What does Tom\u2019s approach to painting the fence reveal about his character?", "A": "He feels excited about completing the task and does it quickly.", "B": "He is indifferent to the job and paints it without any plan or purpose.", "C": "He feels resentful about the task and tries to avoid it altogether.", "D": "He cleverly finds a way to make the job easier by attracting help.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Tom uses exaggerated enthusiasm to make others interested in the task, showing his cleverness in finding a way to make his job easier by enlisting help.Choice A is incorrect because Tom is not genuinely excited about painting; he only pretends to be to attract others. Choice C is incorrect because, while Tom dislikes the task, he doesn\u2019t avoid it; he finds a creative solution.
