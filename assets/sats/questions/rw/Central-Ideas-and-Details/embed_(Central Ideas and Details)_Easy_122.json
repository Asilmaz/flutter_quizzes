The memory of the Bishop\u2019s generosity filled him with a sense of warmth he hadn\u2019t felt in years. It was as if a small light had been kindled within him, pushing back the darkness he had grown accustomed to. He felt an overwhelming urge to repay that kindness, to prove he could be a better man, one worthy of the trust that had been placed in him.", "question": "What does Valjean\u2019s reflection suggest about his response to the Bishop\u2019s kindness?", "A": "He feels indifferent to the Bishop\u2019s kindness and continues with his old ways.", "B": "He is deeply moved by the Bishop\u2019s compassion and is inspired to change.", "C": "He feels suspicious of the Bishop\u2019s motives and questions his sincerity.", "D": "He feels angered by the Bishop\u2019s actions and wishes to reject them.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Valjean is filled with a sense of warmth and wants to repay that kindness, indicating he is deeply moved by the Bishop\u2019s compassion and inspired to change.Choice A is incorrect because Valjean is far from indifferent; he is profoundly affected.
