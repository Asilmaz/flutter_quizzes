{"introduction": "The following passage is from E. M. Forster\u2019s 1910 novel Howards End. The main character, Margaret, is reflecting on her relationship with her sister, Helen.", "text": "Margaret greeted her with, 'I hope you have forgiven me, Helen.'\nHelen, calm and confident as she always was, replied, 'Forgiven you? But what is there to forgive?'\nMargaret glanced out of the window before saying, 'Oh, a thousand things, dear. I think of them now and then\u2014things I said and should not have said, or didn\u2019t say but should have. All those little misunderstandings.'\nHelen smiled, took Margaret\u2019s hand, and said gently, 'Let\u2019s not bother about those. We understand each other better than we think.' Margaret felt a surge of gratitude and knew Helen\u2019s words were true.", "question": "According to the text, what is most likely true about the relationship between Margaret and Helen?", "A": "Margaret often feels guilty about how she treats Helen.", "B": "Margaret and Helen frequently discuss their misunderstandings in detail.", "C": "Helen views any past misunderstandings as inconsequential.", "D": "Helen resents Margaret for her past behavior.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "D is the best answer because Helen reassures Margaret by saying, Let\u2019s not bother about those, suggesting she views any past misunderstandings as minor or unimportant. Helen\u2019s response implies that she holds no lingering resentment or concern over past incidents.Choice A is incorrect because, while Margaret expresses regret over past actions, there is no evidence that she often feels guilty about her behavior towards Helen\u2014she only mentions occasional reflections. Choice B is incorrect because Helen does not appear resentful; rather, she shows affection and understanding toward Margaret. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication that the sisters frequently discuss misunderstandings. Instead, Helen\u2019s words imply they move beyond small issues easily."}
