	"introduction": "This excerpt is from a 1920s travel memoir in which the narrator describes an encounter at a busy marketplace.",
	"text": "Crowded stalls pressed in from all sides, each brimming with spices of every hue. A foreign traveler might be dazzled—and overwhelmed—by the shouts of vendors clamoring for attention. Yet, amid the cacophony, I found a single vendor quietly intent on carving tiny figurines from wood, heedless of passing crowds.",
	"question": "Which choice best captures the central contrast depicted in the text?",
	"A": "The difference between local and foreign visitors in the marketplace",
	"B": "The marketplace’s general commotion versus one vendor’s tranquil focus",
	"C": "The variety of spices displayed at different stalls",
	"D": "The need for privacy in a bustling communal space",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B correctly identifies the text’s main contrast between the lively, noisy setting and the single vendor’s calm attention to detail. A is incorrect because it focuses on 'local vs. foreign' visitors, which is only briefly mentioned. C is too narrow, focusing on spices alone. D implies a desire for privacy, which is not clearly indicated."
