{"introduction": "The following text is from Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen (1811). Marianne Dashwood is reflecting on her feelings for Mr. Willoughby, a charming young man she once loved.", "text": "Marianne could hardly bear to think of the days she had spent with Willoughby. She had given her heart to him completely, believing in his affection without question. Now, as she looked back, she saw her trust as foolish and her feelings as misguided. The pain of betrayal lingered, yet she felt a strange relief at finally understanding his true character. She resolved to move forward, hoping to grow wiser from the experience.", "question": "What does Marianne\u2019s reflection suggest about her feelings for Willoughby now?", "A": "She believes that he acted rightly and wishes him well without bitterness.", "B": "She still feels deeply in love with him and hopes for reconciliation.", "C": "She blames herself entirely for their separation and longs to change.", "D": "She regrets her trust in him but feels relieved to see his true character.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Marianne feels relief at finally understanding Willoughby\u2019s true nature, suggesting that while she regrets her previous trust, she is ready to move on with a better understanding.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Marianne still loves him or wants reconciliation; she feels betrayed and foolish for trusting him. Choice C is incorrect because, although Marianne regrets her trust, she does not blame herself entirely. Choice D is incorrect because Marianne does not feel that he acted rightly; she feels betrayed and is moving forward with a sense of caution, not well-wishes."}
