{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her feelings toward Mr. Darcy after hearing of his involvement in resolving a difficult situation for her family.", "text": "Elizabeth could scarcely believe what she had heard. Mr. Darcy, whom she had once judged so harshly, had acted with a kindness and generosity that left her both astonished and humbled. Her former prejudice seemed suddenly trivial, and a warmth began to grow within her heart\u2014a feeling she had never expected to associate with him. She realized that perhaps her earlier judgments had blinded her to his true character, and she found herself rethinking everything she thought she knew about him.", "question": "What does Elizabeth\u2019s reaction suggest about her changing feelings toward Mr. Darcy?", "A": "She feels increasingly appreciative and begins to reconsider her previous judgments.", "B": "She feels indifferent to his actions and maintains her previous opinion of him.", "C": "She is embarrassed by his generosity and decides to avoid him.", "D": "She is suspicious of his actions and believes he has ulterior motives.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Elizabeth\u2019s feelings shift from prejudice to astonishment and warmth, indicating that she is beginning to appreciate Mr. Darcy\u2019s character and reconsider her earlier judgments.Choice A is incorrect because Elizabeth is not indifferent; she is surprised and touched by Darcy\u2019s actions. Choice C is incorrect because she does not decide to avoid him; instead, she reflects on his true character. Choice D is incorrect because Elizabeth does not view his actions with suspicion; she feels appreciation and begins to understand him better."}
