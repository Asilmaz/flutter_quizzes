{"introduction": "The following text is from Little Women by Louisa May Alcott (1868). Marmee, the girls' mother, is speaking to Jo about the importance of controlling her temper.", "text": "I've learned to check my hasty words, Jo, and to watch myself, though it was hard at first. I am angry nearly every day of my life, but I've learned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do so. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it. Yours may never be conquered, but you can keep it from conquering you.", "question": "What lesson is Marmee trying to teach Jo in this passage?", "A": "That anger is a weakness that should be ignored.", "B": "That controlling one\u2019s temper is a lifelong effort.", "C": "That Jo should embrace her temper as part of her personality.", "D": "That Jo should never feel anger at all.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Marmee explains that learning to control one\u2019s temper is difficult and takes time, and she shares that she continues to work on it even after many years, suggesting it is a lifelong effort.Choice A is incorrect because Marmee acknowledges that she feels anger herself, but she strives to manage it rather than eliminate it entirely. Choice C is incorrect because Marmee does not suggest Jo should embrace her temper; she encourages her to control it. Choice D is incorrect because Marmee does not view anger as a weakness that should be ignored, but rather as a challenge that requires discipline to manage."}
