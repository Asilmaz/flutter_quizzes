{"introduction": "The following text is from The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy (1886). Michael Henchard, the mayor, reflects on his past mistakes and regrets.", "text": "As he walked through the streets of Casterbridge, Henchard was haunted by the choices he had made, the moments of rash anger and pride that had shaped his life. The memories clung to him like shadows, a constant reminder of the man he had once been and the people he had hurt. He wished he could go back and alter those moments, but he knew the past was unchangeable. The only path forward was to accept his regrets and try to live with them, though it felt like a heavy burden.", "question": "Based on the text, how does Henchard feel about his past?", "A": "He feels indifferent to the mistakes he has made, as they no longer affect him.", "B": "He feels that others should bear the responsibility for his mistakes.", "C": "He is proud of his past choices and believes they were justified.", "D": "He wishes he could change the past but understands he must live with his regrets.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Henchard reflects on his regret and his desire to change his past, but he acknowledges that he must accept his mistakes and live with the consequences.Choice A is incorrect because Henchard is clearly affected by his past mistakes; he feels haunted by them. Choice C is incorrect because Henchard does not express pride in his choices; he regrets them. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Henchard blames others; he is focused on his own responsibility and regret."}
