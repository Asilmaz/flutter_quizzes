{"introduction": "The following text is from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens (1861). Pip, the protagonist, is reflecting on his relationship with Estella, a young woman he admires.", "text": "I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her nonetheless because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection. To me, she was something beyond reproach, something even beyond my own understanding.", "question": "Based on the text, what best describes Pip\u2019s feelings for Estella?", "A": "He feels only friendship for her and wishes her the best.", "B": "He is indifferent to her, as he knows she will never return his affection.", "C": "He feels a deep, irrational love for her, despite knowing it may lead to pain.", "D": "He admires her for her kindness and considers her a close friend.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Pip describes his love for Estella as existing against reason and against peace, indicating that his love is both deep and irrational, and he continues to love her despite knowing it may lead to disappointment.Choice A is incorrect because Pip\u2019s feelings go far beyond friendship; he is passionately in love with her. Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention of Estella being kind or Pip considering her a friend; he loves her with intensity. Choice D is incorrect because Pip is anything but indifferent; his love for Estella is all-consuming."}
