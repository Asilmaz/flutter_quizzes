{"introduction": "The following text is from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray is contemplating the portrait that bears the mark of his actions.", "text": "Dorian stared at the portrait, unable to look away. The face that stared back at him was his own, yet twisted with a cruelty and weariness that he no longer recognized. He touched his own cheek, smooth and youthful, and then looked again at the picture, where the signs of corruption and time were etched deeply. He felt a shiver of both horror and fascination, realizing the price of his choices, and yet, he wondered if he could ever truly turn back.", "question": "What does Dorian\u2019s reaction to the portrait suggest about his feelings?", "A": "He believes the portrait\u2019s changes are an illusion and dismisses them.", "B": "He wishes to destroy the portrait to escape its influence on him.", "C": "He feels proud of his youthful appearance and ignores the portrait\u2019s changes.", "D": "He is horrified by the portrait but is also strangely drawn to it.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Dorian feels both horror and fascination as he looks at the portrait, indicating he is drawn to it despite being horrified by the reflection of his own corruption.Choice A is incorrect because, although Dorian recognizes his youth, he does not feel pride; instead, he feels disturbed. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not suggest he wishes to destroy the portrait; he is captivated by it despite his horror. Choice D is incorrect because Dorian does not dismiss the portrait\u2019s changes as an illusion; he acknowledges them as a consequence of his actions."}
