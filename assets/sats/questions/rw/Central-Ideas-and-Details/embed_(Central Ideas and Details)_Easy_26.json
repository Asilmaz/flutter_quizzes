{"introduction": "The following text is from Silent Spring by Rachel Carson (1962). Carson describes the effects of pesticides on the environment, focusing on their impact on birds.", "text": "These sprays, dusts, and aerosols are now applied almost universally to farms, gardens, forests, and homes\u2014nonselective chemicals that have the power to kill every insect, the 'good' and the 'bad,' to still the song of birds and the leaping of fish in the streams, to coat the leaves with a deadly film, and to linger on in soil. But along with their power to kill, these substances possess another property, perhaps even more sinister. They are persistent. They do not disappear from the soil; they accumulate in the tissues of living things, and in time, their effects are passed on to new generations.", "question": "According to the text, what is one reason Carson finds pesticides particularly harmful?", "A": "They are not easily broken down and accumulate in living organisms.", "B": "They kill only certain types of insects, allowing others to flourish unchecked.", "C": "They lose their effectiveness over time, requiring repeated applications.", "D": "They prevent farmers from using natural methods of pest control.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Carson emphasizes that these pesticides are \u201cpersistent\u201d and accumulate in living organisms, making them especially dangerous as their effects can carry over to future generations.Choice A is incorrect because Carson describes the chemicals as \u201cnonselective,\u201d meaning they kill all types of insects rather than only certain ones. Choice C is incorrect because there is no mention of the pesticides losing effectiveness; rather, the issue is their long-lasting presence. Choice D is incorrect because Carson does not discuss natural pest control methods or claim that pesticides prevent their use."}
