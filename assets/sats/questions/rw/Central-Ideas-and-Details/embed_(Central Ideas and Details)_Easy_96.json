Jean Valjean reflects on the kindness shown to him by Bishop Myriel and its effect on his heart and conscience.", "text": "Jean Valjean sat alone in the quiet room, the Bishop\u2019s words echoing in his mind. The man\u2019s compassion had shaken him to his core, awakening something he had long buried under years of bitterness. Valjean felt a strange warmth, a desire to become better, to repay the trust that had been shown to him. It was as if a new path had opened up before him, and he wondered if it was not too late to change, to become the man the Bishop believed he could be.", "question": "What does Valjean\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward the Bishop\u2019s kindness?", "A": "He feels confused by the Bishop\u2019s kindness and dismisses it as foolishness.", "B": "He is angered by the Bishop\u2019s compassion and vows never to change.", "C": "He feels indifferent to the Bishop\u2019s actions and remains unaffected.", "D": "He is deeply moved by the Bishop\u2019s kindness and considers changing his ways.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Valjean feels a desire to become better after experiencing the Bishop\u2019s kindness, indicating he is deeply moved and considering a change in his life.Choice A is incorrect because Valjean does not dismiss the kindness; he is moved by it. Choice B is incorrect because he is not angered; he is inspired to change. Choice D is incorrect because Valjean is far from indifferent; he is profoundly affected by the Bishop\u2019s compassion."}
