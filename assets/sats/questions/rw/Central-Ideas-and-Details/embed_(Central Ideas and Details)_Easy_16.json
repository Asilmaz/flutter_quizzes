	"introduction": "This text is adapted from a modern philosopher’s treatise on the notion of subjectivity in personal narratives.",
	"text": "No two individuals, though they may chronicle the same event, construct identical accounts. Each memory, shaped by personal bias and emotional states, yields a perspective that is uniquely that writer’s own. As such, absolute objectivity in storytelling remains elusive.",
	"question": "Which concept is the philosopher emphasizing?",
	"A": "All events are recalled with perfect clarity, regardless of perspective.",
	"B": "Objective storytelling can be achieved through collaborative editing.",
	"C": "Subjective filters inevitably color individuals’ recollections of shared experiences.",
	"D": "Personal bias plays no role when narrating widely witnessed phenomena.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the text specifically states that each memory is influenced by personal bias. A, B, and D are contrary to the idea that perfect objectivity is unattainable."
