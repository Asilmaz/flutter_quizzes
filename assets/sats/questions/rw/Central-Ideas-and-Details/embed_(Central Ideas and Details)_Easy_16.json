{"introduction": "The following text is from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens (1861). Pip, a young boy, has gone to visit Miss Havisham, a wealthy and reclusive woman.", "text": "Once more, as he looked about him while passing along the gloomy passages, he wished that he was well out of that strange house. He tried to keep close at Estella\u2019s side, but she laughed contemptuously and told him he had to go on alone. Pip shivered, feeling the chill of the damp air and the weight of the silence pressing down on him, making him more anxious with every step.", "question": "Why does Pip feel uneasy in Miss Havisham\u2019s house?", "A": "He believes Estella dislikes him and is uncomfortable around her.", "B": "He is worried that Miss Havisham will criticize his appearance.", "C": "He is frightened by the silence and gloomy surroundings.", "D": "He is anxious because he is unfamiliar with Miss Havisham\u2019s wealth.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "A is the best answer because the text describes Pip feeling the \u201cchill of the damp air\u201d and the \u201cweight of the silence,\u201d indicating that the silent and gloomy atmosphere of the house is making him feel uneasy.Choice B is incorrect because the text does not mention Pip being concerned about his appearance or fearing Miss Havisham\u2019s judgment on it. Choice C is incorrect because, while Estella does speak to Pip with contempt, his unease is directed at the house\u2019s atmosphere rather than her behavior. Choice D is incorrect because Pip\u2019s discomfort comes from the house\u2019s eerie surroundings, not from any unfamiliarity with wealth."}
