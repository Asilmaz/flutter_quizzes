	"introduction": "Excerpt from an ethnographer’s field notes on a remote island community’s agricultural rituals.",
	"text": "Before sowing each year’s crops, elders gather to chant prayers of abundance, believing these incantations influence rainfall and soil fertility. Younger members initially dismissed the rituals as archaic, but have slowly begun to participate, spurred by a series of unusually bountiful harvests.",
	"question": "Which statement is best supported by the text regarding the community’s attitude toward its traditional rituals?",
	"A": "Younger members completely reject the elders’ beliefs, citing lack of scientific proof.",
	"B": "Unusually successful harvests have encouraged the youth to take part in longstanding rites.",
	"C": "The community holds the rituals strictly in secret, barring the presence of non-locals.",
	"D": "All members have ceased performing rituals due to consistent crop failures.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the younger members begin to join after seeing the positive results. A and D contradict the evidence of renewed interest and success, and C is not suggested by the passage."
