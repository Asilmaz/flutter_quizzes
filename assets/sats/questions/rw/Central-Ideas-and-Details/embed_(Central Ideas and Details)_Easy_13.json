{"introduction": "The following text is from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851). Ishmael, the narrator, describes the behavior of whales when they sense danger.", "text": "Whales, it is well known, are some of the most cautious and observant creatures in the ocean. When threatened, they do not immediately flee, but instead form tight, protective circles. Larger, older whales move to the outer edges, shielding the young ones within. This remarkable defensive formation has been the source of much fascination for whalers, who find it challenging to approach them when they are so arranged.", "question": "According to the text, what is one reason whales form protective circles?", "A": "To create a stronger current that aids in their escape.", "B": "To intimidate whalers and other threats with their size.", "C": "To communicate with each other through close contact.", "D": "To protect the younger whales from potential danger.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because the text indicates that larger whales position themselves on the outer edges of the circle to shield the younger ones, suggesting that the circle is formed to protect them from potential danger.Choice A is incorrect because there is no mention of whales trying to intimidate threats; the formation is described as a defensive measure, not an aggressive one. Choice C is incorrect because while the whales are close together, the text does not imply that this is for communication. Choice D is incorrect because the circle formation is described as a defensive position rather than a strategy to create currents for escape."}
