{"introduction": "The following text is from Native Son by Richard Wright (1940). Bigger Thomas is reflecting on his life in Chicago and the limitations he faces due to his race and social status.", "text": "It seemed to him that the walls of the city closed in on him, that every street he walked was just another reminder of all he could never have. He felt trapped, unable to escape the smallness of his world and the way it was determined by forces he couldn\u2019t control. The weight of his circumstances was heavy, pressing down on him with a constant reminder of who he was supposed to be, a feeling that made him both angry and hopeless.", "question": "According to the text, how does Bigger feel about his life and opportunities?", "A": "He feels empowered to change his circumstances.", "B": "He is indifferent, believing that life is unchangeable for everyone.", "C": "He is content with his life and has no desire for change.", "D": "He feels confined and hopeless about his situation.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Bigger feels trapped and hopeless about his circumstances, indicating that he sees little chance of escaping his current situation.Choice A is incorrect because Bigger does not feel empowered; he feels confined and powerless. Choice C is incorrect because he is not content; he feels angry and hopeless. Choice D is incorrect because Bigger\u2019s feelings are far from indifferent; he is very aware of and affected by the limitations imposed on him."}
