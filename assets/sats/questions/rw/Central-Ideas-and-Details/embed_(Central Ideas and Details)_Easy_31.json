{"introduction": "The following text is from The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton (1905). Lily Bart, a young woman from New York\u2019s high society, is attending a grand social gathering.", "text": "Lily stood at the edge of the crowded room, observing the swirl of laughter and voices around her. She felt a strange detachment, as if she were a spectator rather than a participant in the scene. She was struck by the thought that, while she was surrounded by all the splendor and wealth she had always admired, something essential was missing. She realized, with a faint sense of unease, that this world did not quite satisfy the deeper yearnings of her soul.", "question": "Which choice best describes Lily\u2019s feelings about her social environment?", "A": "She feels that the luxury around her does not fulfill her deeper desires.", "B": "She is overwhelmed by the wealth and splendor surrounding her.", "C": "She is content to be a spectator rather than a participant in society.", "D": "She wishes she could escape the high-society life and live in solitude.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Lily feels that, despite the wealth and splendor she once admired, there is something deeper missing that leaves her unfulfilled.Choice A is incorrect because Lily does not feel overwhelmed; rather, she is detached and reflective. Choice C is incorrect because, although she feels like a spectator, this is not presented as a source of contentment. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Lily wishes to leave high society; she simply feels that it does not satisfy her deeper desires."}
