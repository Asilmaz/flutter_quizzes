Raskolnikov reflects on the murder he committed, struggling with guilt and the moral weight of his actions.", "text": "Raskolnikov felt as though he were split in two, one part of him justifying his crime, insisting that it was for the greater good, while the other part recoiled in horror. His mind was plagued by visions of the old woman\u2019s face, her eyes frozen in shock. He could feel the walls closing in, his reasoning twisting under the weight of guilt. The clarity he had once felt about his actions was fading, replaced by a sense of dread he could not shake.", "question": "What does Raskolnikov\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward his crime?", "A": "He feels a deep sense of dread and is haunted by guilt.", "B": "He feels completely justified and experiences no remorse.", "C": "He feels proud of his actions and seeks validation from others.", "D": "He is indifferent to the crime and views it as inconsequential.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Raskolnikov feels horror and a sense of dread about his actions, indicating he is haunted by guilt and no longer certain of his justification.Choice A is incorrect because Raskolnikov does not feel completely justified; he is plagued by guilt. Choice C is incorrect because Raskolnikov does not feel pride; he is horrified and troubled by his actions. Choice D is incorrect because he is far from indifferent; he is deeply affected and haunted by the crime."}
