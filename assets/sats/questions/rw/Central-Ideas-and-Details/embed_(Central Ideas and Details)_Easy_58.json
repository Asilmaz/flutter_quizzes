{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet is reflecting on her feelings toward Mr. Darcy after hearing about his involvement in her family's affairs.", "text": "Elizabeth could scarcely believe what she had heard. Mr. Darcy, whom she had once judged so harshly, had acted with a kindness and generosity that left her both astonished and humbled. Her previous prejudice seemed foolish now, and she felt a warmth toward him that had not existed before. She wondered if she had been wrong about him all along, and if perhaps, there was much more to his character than she had allowed herself to see.", "question": "What does Elizabeth\u2019s reaction suggest about her changing feelings toward Mr. Darcy?", "A": "She feels frustrated that she misunderstood him but refuses to admit her error.", "B": "She is increasingly appreciative and re-evaluates her earlier judgments of him.", "C": "She feels indifferent to his actions and remains skeptical of his intentions.", "D": "She is eager to avoid him because she believes he has manipulated her family.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Elizabeth feels astonished and humbled by Mr. Darcy\u2019s kindness, indicating that she is beginning to re-evaluate her previous judgments and feel a sense of appreciation for him.Choice A is incorrect because Elizabeth is not indifferent; she is moved by Darcy\u2019s actions. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication that she feels frustrated or is unwilling to admit her mistake; she is open to seeing him differently. Choice D is incorrect because Elizabeth\u2019s reaction is not one of avoidance or distrust; she is instead rethinking her previous assumptions about him."}
