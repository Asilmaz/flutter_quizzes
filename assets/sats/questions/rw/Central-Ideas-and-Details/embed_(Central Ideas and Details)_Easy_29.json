{"introduction": "The following text is from Little Women by Louisa May Alcott (1868). Jo March is describing her younger sister, Beth, and her love for music.", "text": "Beth was too shy to go to concerts, but she dearly loved music, and would often spend hours at the old piano, playing softly to herself. She knew her own limitations and never wished to perform for others, but the simple pleasure of the music was enough for her. Jo would sometimes sit nearby, listening quietly, admiring the gentle, content expression that always came over Beth\u2019s face as she played.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "A": "Beth feels disappointed that she cannot play music as well as others.", "B": "Beth is determined to become a famous musician despite her shyness.", "C": "Beth finds joy and comfort in playing music privately.", "D": "Jo wishes that Beth would perform publicly to showcase her talent.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because the text describes Beth\u2019s contentment and joy in playing music alone, highlighting her love for the activity itself rather than any desire for recognition.Choice A is incorrect because Beth does not aspire to become a famous musician; she prefers to play privately. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication that Jo wants Beth to perform publicly; instead, Jo appreciates Beth\u2019s private enjoyment of music. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Beth feels disappointed in her abilities; she finds pleasure in playing for herself."}
