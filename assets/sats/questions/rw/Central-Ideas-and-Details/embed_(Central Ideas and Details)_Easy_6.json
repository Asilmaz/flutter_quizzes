	"introduction": "From a 21st-century sociological study on group decision-making and collective behavior.",
	"text": "When consensus-building fails, it is typically because the group has not established trust among its members. In many instances, the introduction of a single, overtly dominant voice suppresses diverse perspectives, ultimately leading to groupthink rather than true agreement.",
	"question": "Which factor does the text identify as a primary cause of failed consensus-building?",
	"A": "Excessive adherence to open-ended dialogue",
	"B": "The unintentional ignoring of minority opinions by a neutral leader",
	"C": "The overbearing influence of one particularly forceful participant",
	"D": "An established trust-based framework for negotiation",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C aligns with the text’s statement about a ‘single, overtly dominant voice’ causing groupthink. A is not mentioned, B does not appear in the text, and D is the opposite of what leads to failure—trust fosters consensus, not failure."
