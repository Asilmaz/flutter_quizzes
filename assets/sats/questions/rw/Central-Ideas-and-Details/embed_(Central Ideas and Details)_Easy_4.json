{"introduction": "The following text is from To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf (1927). Mr. Ramsay, a philosopher, contemplates his achievements and his legacy.", "text": "He wanted sympathy. He was a failure, he repeated. He felt it to be true. And at the same time, he felt the impossibility of reaching the highest peak, the sense that his work, no matter how well done, would only ever reach a certain level. He was tormented by the thought that he would never achieve greatness, that he would always remain, to his mind, in the shadow of other, greater thinkers. He longed for recognition, yet he could not shake the doubt that it would ever come.", "question": "According to the text, what is one reason Mr. Ramsay feels dissatisfied?", "A": "He is unable to find sympathy from those around him.", "B": "He thinks his ideas are misunderstood by others.", "C": "He believes his work lacks true purpose.", "D": "He feels he will never achieve true greatness.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Mr. Ramsay is described as feeling that he will \u201cnever achieve greatness\u201d and will always be overshadowed by other thinkers. This sense of inadequacy and unattainable ambition is central to his dissatisfaction.Choice A is incorrect because, although Mr. Ramsay does desire sympathy, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that his lack of sympathy from others is the main source of his dissatisfaction. Choice B is incorrect because Mr. Ramsay\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from a perceived limitation in his achievements, not a belief that his work lacks purpose. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that he feels misunderstood by others; rather, he doubts his own potential to reach the heights of intellectual greatness he aspires to."}
