	"introduction": "Adapted from a 19th-century journalist’s commentary on public debates about education reform.",
	"text": "Public discourse on schooling has grown fervent. Some advocate for uniform curricula and rigid standards, while others champion localized autonomy. Strangely, amidst the clamor, few address the need for teacher independence, arguably the very bedrock of an adaptive classroom.",
	"question": "Which issue does the text suggest is being overlooked in the debates on education reform?",
	"A": "Funding for teachers’ salaries",
	"B": "A cohesive and standardized curriculum",
	"C": "Support for flexible, teacher-driven decision making",
	"D": "Access to advanced technology in classrooms",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the text explicitly states that teacher independence is 'the very bedrock' that few address. A is never mentioned. B is actually one of the advocated approaches, so it’s not being overlooked. D is not raised in the passage."
