{"introduction": "The following text is from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle (1892). Sherlock Holmes is explaining his method of solving cases to Dr. Watson.", "text": "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\nFrequently.\nHow often?\nWell, some hundreds of times.\nThen how many are there?\nHow many! I don't know.\nQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.", "question": "According to the text, what is one reason Holmes believes he is able to solve cases effectively?", "A": "He relies on Watson to recall important information.", "B": "He memorizes every object and person he encounters.", "C": "He constantly reexamines each case multiple times.", "D": "He notices details that others often overlook.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "A is the best answer because Holmes emphasizes the importance of observation over merely seeing, which allows him to notice details that others miss, contributing to his success as a detective.Choice B is incorrect because Holmes does not claim to memorize everything but rather stresses the difference between seeing and observing. Choice C is incorrect because Holmes does not mention reexamining cases; instead, he emphasizes initial observation. Choice D is incorrect because Holmes criticizes Watson for not observing, indicating that he does not rely on Watson for recalling details."}
