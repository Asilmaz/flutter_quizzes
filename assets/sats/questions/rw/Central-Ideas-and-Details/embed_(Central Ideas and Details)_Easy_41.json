{"introduction": "The following text is from Far from the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy (1874). Gabriel Oak, a shepherd, is reflecting on his first meeting with Bathsheba Everdene.", "text": "He had never seen a woman so full of spirit and grace. There was something in her manner that held a rare confidence, a charm that seemed unforced and natural. As he watched her from a distance, he felt an admiration that was both humbling and unsettling. She was, he thought, as wild and free as the landscape around them, and he wondered if a woman like her could ever be tamed by someone like him.", "question": "How does Gabriel feel about Bathsheba in this passage?", "A": "He thinks she would be better suited to a life away from the countryside.", "B": "He feels intimidated by her confidence and decides to avoid her.", "C": "He believes she is uninterested in him and feels discouraged.", "D": "He admires her spirit and finds himself drawn to her natural charm.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Gabriel is described as feeling admiration for Bathsheba\u2019s spirit and natural charm, finding her both humbling and fascinating.Choice A is incorrect because, although he is humbled by her confidence, there is no indication that he intends to avoid her. Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t suggest that Gabriel feels discouraged; rather, he is captivated by her. Choice D is incorrect because Gabriel does not imply that Bathsheba is unsuited to the countryside; he compares her spirit to the landscape, suggesting he sees her as part of it."}
