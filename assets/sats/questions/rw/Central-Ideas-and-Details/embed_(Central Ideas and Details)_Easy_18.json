{"introduction": "The following text is from The Call of the Wild by Jack London (1903). Buck, a domesticated dog, has been sold into the harsh life of an Alaskan sled dog. He is learning to adapt to the wilderness.", "text": "Buck learned quickly. Each day he was taught the ways of the wild, and his old life slipped further into memory. The team taught him to steal food and fight for his survival, while his instincts urged him to be cautious of his surroundings. He could no longer rely on the kindness of men but instead had to adapt to the primal law of club and fang. Buck was beginning to understand that survival meant strength, cunning, and learning the rules of the wild.", "question": "According to the text, what is one way Buck is adapting to his new life?", "A": "He refuses to steal food because he remembers his old life.", "B": "He is beginning to ignore his instincts to fit in with the other dogs.", "C": "He is relying on his instincts and learning the ways of survival.", "D": "He is slowly regaining trust in humans through his experiences.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "A is the best answer because the text describes how Buck is learning \u201cthe ways of the wild\u201d and relying on his instincts to survive, which shows he is adapting to his new environment by embracing survival skills.Choice B is incorrect because Buck is actually listening to his instincts rather than ignoring them. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions that Buck has learned to steal food as part of his adaptation, not that he refuses to do so. Choice D is incorrect because Buck is becoming more independent and less reliant on humans, not regaining trust in them."}
