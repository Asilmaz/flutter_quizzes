	"introduction": "Excerpt from a literary critic’s overview of an early modern playwright’s comedic works.",
	"text": "In these comedic scenes, the humor stems not from grand spectacles but from an intricate dance of concealed identities. Characters speak in riddles, revealing truths only when they mistakenly believe themselves among friends. The audience, privy to every deception, delights in the tension between sincerity and disguise.",
	"question": "What is the primary source of comedic effect according to the passage?",
	"A": "Elaborate physical humor and slapstick",
	"B": "Irony generated by the characters’ hidden personas and near confessions",
	"C": "Long soliloquies in which the characters openly discuss their secrets",
	"D": "A single, grand spectacle that captivates the audience",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B captures how comedic tension arises from hidden identities and mistaken moments of revelation. A and D are explicitly ruled out by the emphasis on subtlety over spectacle, and C is incorrect because the text highlights partial concealment, not open discussions."
