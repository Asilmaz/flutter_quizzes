{"introduction": "The following text is from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain (1884). Huck is describing his friend Jim, a runaway slave, as they travel down the Mississippi River.", "text": "Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me. I had heard about some of these things before, but not everything. Jim knew all kinds of signs and superstitions, and he would explain them all to me. Sometimes, I thought it was foolish, but other times, I wondered if there was something to it.", "question": "According to the text, what is one reason Huck is interested in Jim\u2019s superstitions?", "A": "He is curious about whether there might be some truth to them.", "B": "He feels they are proven facts that he wants to understand better.", "C": "He thinks Jim\u2019s beliefs make him seem more intelligent.", "D": "He worries that Jim\u2019s superstitions will bring them bad luck.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Huck indicates that although he sometimes finds Jim\u2019s superstitions foolish, he also wonders if there might be some truth to them, suggesting a mix of curiosity and skepticism.Choice A is incorrect because Huck does not view the superstitions as proven facts but rather as beliefs he is curious about. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest Huck thinks the superstitions make Jim seem more intelligent; it simply shows Huck\u2019s interest in them. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Huck fears bad luck from Jim\u2019s beliefs; his reaction is more one of curiosity than fear."}
