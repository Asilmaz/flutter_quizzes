	"introduction": "An excerpt from a 20th-century political speech on grassroots organizing.",

	"question": "What does the speaker argue about small local gatherings?",
	"A": "They squander resources that could be directed toward large formal committees.",
	"B": "They are a critical catalyst for broader community engagement.",

	"D": "They attract opposition leaders looking to undermine grassroots efforts.",
