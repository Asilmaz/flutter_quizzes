{"introduction": "The following text is from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb (1847). Jane, a young governess, is speaking with her employer, Mr. Rochester, about her desire for independence.", "text": "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you. Jane\u2019s voice was steady, yet filled with a quiet determination. She wanted Mr. Rochester to understand that, despite her feelings, she could not be bound by anyone\u2019s wishes but her own. To her, freedom was a principle she would never surrender, even if it meant leaving behind someone she cared for deeply.", "question": "According to the text, what is one reason Jane wishes to leave Mr. Rochester?", "A": "She feels she has no future at Thornfield Hall.", "B": "She has found a new position that offers her greater freedom.", "C": "She believes Mr. Rochester no longer values her company.", "D": "She is unwilling to sacrifice her independence.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Jane emphasizes her independent will and her need to maintain her freedom, showing that she values her independence above all else, even her connection to Mr. Rochester.Choice A is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Jane feels there is no future for her at Thornfield; rather, her decision is based on her principles. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication that Mr. Rochester does not value Jane\u2019s company; the decision is rooted in Jane\u2019s need for autonomy. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not mention Jane finding a new position; her desire to leave is due to her need for personal freedom."}
