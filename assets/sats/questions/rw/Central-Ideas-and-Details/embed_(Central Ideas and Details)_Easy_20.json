{"introduction": "The following text is from The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin (1859), where Darwin discusses his observations of natural selection and evolution in nature.", "text": "It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the lapse of ages.", "question": "According to the text, what is Darwin\u2019s view on how natural selection operates?", "A": "Natural selection works only in environments with constant changes.", "B": "Natural selection rapidly alters species to adapt to new conditions.", "C": "Natural selection favors only the strongest members of a species.", "D": "Natural selection gradually improves organisms over long periods.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Darwin describes natural selection as a process that \u201csilently and insensibly\u201d works on organisms over \u201cthe lapse of ages,\u201d suggesting that it gradually improves organisms over long periods.Choice A is incorrect because Darwin suggests that natural selection operates constantly, not only in environments with constant changes. Choice B is incorrect because Darwin emphasizes that changes occur slowly over time, not rapidly. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not imply that only the strongest survive; rather, it suggests that favorable traits are preserved regardless of strength."}
