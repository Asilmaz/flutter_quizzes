It was as if invisible walls surrounded him, keeping him confined within boundaries he hadn\u2019t chosen. He could see the life he wanted somewhere beyond those walls, but it remained out of reach, taunting him. Anger simmered inside him, mixed with a helplessness that seemed to drain his will, trapping him in a cage he could neither see nor escape.", "question": "What does Bigger\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward his situation?", "A": "He feels frustrated and trapped by the limitations imposed on him by society.", "B": "He feels indifferent to his circumstances and chooses not to think about them.", "C": "He feels proud of his place in society and strives to maintain it.", "D": "He feels content with his life and sees no reason for change.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Bigger feels a weight pressing down on him and describes his life as being confined by invisible walls, indicating that he feels trapped and frustrated by societal limitations.Choice A is incorrect because Bigger does not feel content; he feels constrained and frustrated.
