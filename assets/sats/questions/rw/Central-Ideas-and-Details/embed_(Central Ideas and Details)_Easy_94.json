{"introduction": "The following text is from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens (1861). Pip is reflecting on his changing feelings toward Joe, the blacksmith who raised him, after moving to a higher social class.", "text": "As Pip walked through the streets of London, he couldn\u2019t shake the sense of shame he felt at the thought of Joe. The memory of Joe\u2019s kindness and warmth lingered in his heart, yet he found himself embarrassed by Joe\u2019s rough manners and simple life. He felt torn, as if his desire for a grander life had somehow distanced him from the honest affection Joe had always shown him. It was as though he were caught between two worlds, unable to fully embrace either.", "question": "What does Pip\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward Joe?", "A": "He feels indifferent to Joe\u2019s influence and has moved on completely.", "B": "He is eager to return to Joe and abandon his ambitions in London.", "C": "He feels entirely ashamed of Joe and wishes to sever all ties.", "D": "He is grateful for Joe\u2019s kindness but embarrassed by his humble lifestyle.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Pip feels embarrassed by Joe\u2019s rough manners but also remembers his kindness and warmth, showing that he is grateful but conflicted due to his desire for a grander life.Choice A is incorrect because Pip is not indifferent; he is deeply affected by his relationship with Joe. Choice C is incorrect because Pip does not entirely wish to sever ties; he feels conflicted, not purely ashamed. Choice D is incorrect because Pip does not express a desire to abandon his ambitions; he is caught between his new life and his past."}
