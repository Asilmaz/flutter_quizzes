{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway is observing his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, at one of his grand parties.", "text": "Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps, looked out over his guests with a strange mix of satisfaction and detachment. Though the laughter and music surrounded him, his gaze was distant, as if he were searching for something beyond the revelry around him. His expression held a hint of longing, a quiet yearning that seemed out of place amidst the noise and splendor of the party.", "question": "According to the text, what is most likely true about Gatsby\u2019s feelings during the party?", "A": "He is pleased with the success of the party and feels fully content.", "B": "He feels disconnected from the celebration, as if longing for something else.", "C": "He is overwhelmed by the number of guests and wishes for solitude.", "D": "He is disappointed by the behavior of his guests and wants the party to end.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Gatsby\u2019s \u201cdistant\u201d gaze and the \u201chint of longing\u201d in his expression suggest that he feels disconnected from the festivities and is yearning for something beyond the party.Choice A is incorrect because, although Gatsby may feel some satisfaction, his expression of detachment and longing indicates that he is not fully content. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Gatsby is overwhelmed or specifically wants to be alone; his focus appears to be elsewhere rather than on the guests themselves. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Gatsby is disappointed in his guests or wants the party to end; rather, he is simply disengaged from it, as if preoccupied with another desire."}
