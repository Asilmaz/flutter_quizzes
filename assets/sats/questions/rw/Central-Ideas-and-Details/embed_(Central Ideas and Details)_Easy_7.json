	"question": "What does the text convey about the narrator’s emotional state?",
	"A": "They are overwhelmed with despair at the sight of the ruined landscape.",
	"B": "They find a glimmer of optimism despite the seemingly desolate surroundings.",
	"C": "They are certain that the road will lead them to a crowded metropolis.",
	"D": "They are resentful about being forced to travel through a deserted place.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because the narrator explicitly mentions ‘a quiet promise’ and ‘unspoken assurance.’ A is incorrect; the narrator feels hope. C is not supported by the text; there's no mention of a city. D is also unsupported; the text never suggests resentment."
