	"introduction": "Excerpt from a literary essay on late Romantic poets’ approach to nature imagery.",
	"text": "The second generation of these poets viewed mountains not merely as majestic backdrops but as sentient beings with their own silent narratives. In contrast, earlier poets had treated landscapes as rhetorical devices meant to evoke wonder rather than empathy.",
	"question": "Which statement best describes the shift in nature imagery from earlier poets to the second generation of Romantic poets, according to the text?",
	"A": "It moved from using landscapes purely as symbols to treating them as having agency.",
	"B": "It shifted from poems about supernatural phenomena to poems about everyday life.",
	"C": "It went from an empathetic view to an overtly fearful view of the natural world.",
	"D": "It transitioned from focusing on the moral value of nature to ignoring moral themes altogether.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A captures the shift from rhetorical backdrops to perceived active participants in the poets’ visions. B is inaccurate because the text doesn’t mention everyday life. C is incorrect as there is no mention of fear. D is also not supported; the text emphasizes empathy, not moral considerations."
