The idea of spending his Saturday painting was anything but appealing. But as he thought it over, a sly grin spread across his face. He picked up the brush and started painting with exaggerated care, acting as if it were the most enjoyable activity in the world. He knew that if he played his cards right, he might just convince some of the other boys to beg him for a chance to help.", "question": "What does Tom\u2019s reaction to the task reveal about his character?", "A": "He feels overwhelmed and is considering asking for help from an adult.", "B": "He is diligent and intends to finish the job as quickly as possible.", "C": "He is clever and resourceful, finding a way to turn the chore to his advantage.", "D": "He is indifferent to the task and does not care if it gets done or not.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Tom\u2019s sly grin and his plan to make painting look enjoyable reveal his cleverness and resourcefulness, as he tries to convince others to help him with the chore.Choice A is incorrect because Tom is not focused on completing the task himself; he wants to get others to do it.
