{"introduction": "The following text is from Walden by Henry David Thoreau (1854). Thoreau reflects on his decision to live simply in the woods and observe nature closely.", "text": "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.", "question": "What is Thoreau\u2019s main purpose for living in the woods, according to the text?", "A": "To escape from the responsibilities of society and live in isolation.", "B": "To learn how to survive with limited resources in nature.", "C": "To discover how to build a self-sufficient lifestyle.", "D": "To understand life by focusing only on its essential aspects.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Thoreau expresses a desire to live deliberately and focus on the essential facts of life, suggesting he aims to understand life by examining its most fundamental aspects.Choice A is incorrect because Thoreau\u2019s purpose is not to escape responsibilities but to find deeper meaning. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not mention survival skills; Thoreau\u2019s focus is on understanding life, not survival. Choice D is incorrect because his purpose is not about self-sufficiency in a practical sense, but rather about seeking a deliberate and meaningful existence."}
