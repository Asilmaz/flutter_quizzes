{"introduction": "The following text is from A Room with a View by E. M. Forster (1908). Lucy Honeychurch, a young Englishwoman, is contemplating the constraints of society and her desire for personal freedom.", "text": "She had been brought up to accept certain conventions without question, to act according to a set of invisible rules that governed her world. But now, here in Italy, she felt as though she could glimpse a life beyond those constraints, a life that was her own to shape. She longed to break free, to leave behind the expectations of others and embrace a path that she alone would choose. Yet, even as the desire burned within her, she felt the weight of those very conventions holding her back.", "question": "How does Lucy feel about the societal expectations placed on her?", "A": "She finds them comforting and wants to adhere to them.", "B": "She believes they make life simpler and easier to manage.", "C": "She feels torn between following them and pursuing her own desires.", "D": "She is completely indifferent to them and feels no conflict.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Lucy feels a strong desire to pursue her own path, but she also feels the weight of those very conventions holding her back, indicating an inner conflict between societal expectations and her personal desires.Choice A is incorrect because Lucy does not find comfort in the conventions; instead, she longs to break free from them. Choice C is incorrect because Lucy does not see societal expectations as simplifying her life; rather, she feels constrained by them. Choice D is incorrect because Lucy is far from indifferent; she experiences a strong inner conflict regarding the expectations placed on her."}
