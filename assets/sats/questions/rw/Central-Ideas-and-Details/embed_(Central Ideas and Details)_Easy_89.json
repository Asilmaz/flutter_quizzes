Dorian Gray is observing his portrait, which bears the marks of his actions, while he himself remains physically unchanged.", "text": "Dorian gazed at the portrait with a mixture of horror and fascination. The face in the painting had grown older, lined with signs of cruelty and indulgence, while his own face remained as youthful as ever. He touched his own smooth skin and then looked back at the twisted expression on the canvas. It was as if the painting held a mirror to his soul, revealing the dark consequences of his choices, a truth he could not bear yet could not look away from.", "question": "What does Dorian\u2019s reaction to his portrait reveal about his feelings toward his choices?", "A": "He feels proud of the portrait and is unconcerned by its changes.", "B": "He is horrified by the portrait but cannot resist looking at it.", "C": "He finds the portrait amusing and considers it a harmless reminder of his life.", "D": "He is indifferent to the changes in the portrait and barely notices them.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Dorian feels both horror and fascination as he looks at the portrait, indicating that he is disturbed by the consequences of his choices yet compelled to look.Choice A is incorrect because Dorian does not feel proud or unconcerned; he is horrified. Choice C is incorrect because he does not find the portrait amusing; he is deeply disturbed. Choice D is incorrect because he is far from indifferent; he feels intense horror and fascination."}
