{"introduction": "The following text is from The Awakening by Kate Chopin (1899). Edna Pontellier is reflecting on her newfound sense of independence and freedom as she begins to question the roles expected of her.", "text": "Edna stood on the shore, gazing out at the endless expanse of the sea. The waves seemed to call to her, a vast openness she had never before imagined. She felt a stirring within her, a desire to live life on her own terms, free from the expectations that had always bound her. Yet, even as the thrill of freedom grew, a quiet unease lingered, as if the path ahead was both exhilarating and perilous.", "question": "What does Edna\u2019s reflection reveal about her feelings toward her independence?", "A": "She feels completely confident in her independence and has no reservations.", "B": "She is eager to return to her previous life and abandon her new ideas.", "C": "She feels indifferent to the idea of independence and continues as usual.", "D": "She is excited by her independence but also feels apprehensive about the risks it brings.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Edna feels a stirring and a desire to live life on her own terms, but she also experiences a quiet unease, suggesting that she is both excited by her independence and wary of the potential risks.Choice A is incorrect because Edna does feel some unease and is not entirely confident. Choice C is incorrect because Edna is far from indifferent; she is deeply affected by her sense of freedom. Choice D is incorrect because Edna is not eager to return to her previous life; she desires a new path, even with its uncertainties."}
