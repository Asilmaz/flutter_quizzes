He wondered what it would be like to embrace such a life, to step outside the carefully drawn lines of society. Yet he felt a pull back to the familiar, to the obligations and comforts that came with his place. It was as if two paths lay before him, one paved and predictable, the other wild and uncertain.", "question": "What does Newland\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward Ellen\u2019s independence?", "A": "He admires Ellen\u2019s independence but feels torn between it and his own societal obligations.", "B": "He is entirely committed to maintaining his own traditional life.", "C": "He feels indifferent to Ellen\u2019s choices and is unaffected by her lifestyle.", "D": "He resents Ellen\u2019s independence and disapproves of her disregard for society\u2019s rules.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Newland admires Ellen\u2019s independence and is captivated by her freedom, yet he feels torn between that freedom and the security of his own societal obligations.Choice A is incorrect because, while Newland feels some attachment to his traditional life, he is also drawn to the idea of independence.
