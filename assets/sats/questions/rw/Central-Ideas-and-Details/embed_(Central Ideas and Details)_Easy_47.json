{"introduction": "The following text is from The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton (1920). Newland Archer reflects on the strict social customs of his upper-class society in New York.", "text": "He had long since accepted the fact that in New York society, everything was carefully arranged and regulated. A man could hardly turn around without finding himself ensnared by invisible threads of tradition, reputation, and duty. These threads held everyone in place, like figures in an intricate dance, each movement mapped out before it began. He felt, with a faint sense of frustration, that all choices had been made for him before he was even born.", "question": "How does Newland feel about the social customs in his society?", "A": "He feels frustrated by the restrictions they impose on his choices.", "B": "He admires the order and predictability they bring to his life.", "C": "He believes that these customs will eventually allow him more freedom.", "D": "He is indifferent to the customs, as they do not affect him personally.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Newland feels a faint sense of frustration about the way society\u2019s customs restrict his choices, indicating that he finds them limiting.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Newland admires the social customs; instead, he feels frustrated. Choice C is incorrect because Newland does not believe the customs will grant him freedom; he feels trapped by them. Choice D is incorrect because Newland is not indifferent; he is clearly affected by and aware of the customs\u2019 impact on his life."}
