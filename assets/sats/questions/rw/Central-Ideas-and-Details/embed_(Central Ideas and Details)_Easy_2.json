{"introduction": "The following text is from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Mr. Darcy is reflecting on his actions toward Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet.", "text": "I have been selfish all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child, I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately, an only son (for many years an only child) I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing. To Jane herself, therefore, I have been kinder than to myself.", "question": "According to the text, why does Mr. Darcy believe he acted selfishly?", "A": "He believes he was naturally inclined to be proud and conceited.", "B": "His father was overly strict, which made him stubborn.", "C": "His parents indulged him, encouraging selfishness.", "D": "He was often compared unfavorably to others, leading to insecurity.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Mr. Darcy acknowledges that his parents \u201callowed, encouraged, almost taught [him] to be selfish and overbearing,\u201d which suggests that their indulgent treatment influenced his selfish behavior. His reflection on his upbringing implies that his parents\u2019 actions shaped his character.Choice A is incorrect because Mr. Darcy\u2019s selfishness isn\u2019t attributed to natural inclinations; rather, he sees it as a result of his upbringing. Choice C is incorrect because Darcy describes his father as benevolent and amiable, suggesting kindness, not strictness. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention him being unfavorably compared to others or feeling insecure. Instead, it focuses on how his parents\u2019 indulgence fostered his pride."}
