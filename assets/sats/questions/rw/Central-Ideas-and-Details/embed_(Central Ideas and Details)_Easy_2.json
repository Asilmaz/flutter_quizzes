	"introduction": "This passage is drawn from a contemporary short story about two characters visiting a family estate.",
	"text": "Caroline’s hesitation was palpable when they approached the neglected garden. The once-thriving flowers had wilted, and creeping vines choked the marble statue at the center. Anthony wanted to move on quickly, but Caroline insisted they stay, transfixed by what she called 'beauty in decay.'",
	"question": "According to the text, how does Caroline’s perspective on the garden differ from Anthony’s?",
	"A": "Caroline considers the garden’s ruins deeply fascinating, while Anthony prefers not to dwell on it.",
	"B": "Caroline sees the garden as a symbol of hope, whereas Anthony focuses on practical restoration.",
	"C": "Caroline and Anthony both agree that the garden’s current state is beyond repair.",
	"D": "Caroline blames Anthony for the garden’s deterioration, and Anthony defends himself.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because Caroline finds 'beauty in decay,' while Anthony wants to leave. B is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention hope or restoration. C is incorrect; Anthony’s view is not that it’s irreparable, only that he wants to move on. D is not supported by any mention of blame or defense."
