Lily Bart is attending a high-society gathering, but she feels out of place among the guests.", "text": "As Lily moved through the crowded room, she felt a sense of detachment, as though she were watching everything from a distance. She was surrounded by beauty, luxury, and laughter, but a hollow feeling lingered in her heart. The elegant gowns and glittering jewels seemed like masks, hiding the emptiness she sensed beneath it all. She wondered if she truly belonged in this world or if she was merely a visitor, destined to remain on the outside looking in.", "question": "What does Lily\u2019s reaction to the gathering suggest about her feelings toward high society?", "A": "She is captivated by the wealth and beauty of her surroundings.", "B": "She is eager to gain acceptance from the guests around her.", "C": "She feels disconnected and questions her place within high society.", "D": "She is proud to be part of such an elegant social circle.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Lily feels a sense of detachment and questions whether she belongs, indicating a feeling of disconnection from the high-society world around her.Choice A is incorrect because, while there is beauty around her, she does not feel captivated; rather, she feels hollow and detached.
