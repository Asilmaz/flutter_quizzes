Marmee, the mother of the March sisters, is speaking to Jo about the importance of patience and self-control.", "text": "Jo, dear, I know you feel strongly, and that your temper is fierce, just like mine once was. It takes time and effort to learn patience, to hold back those angry words that rise so quickly. I still struggle with it myself, though I've come a long way. Remember, real strength is found in gentleness and understanding. It\u2019s a hard lesson, but one that will serve you well.", "question": "What lesson is Marmee trying to teach Jo in this passage?", "A": "That Jo should never express her emotions openly.", "B": "That patience and self-control are signs of true strength.", "C": "That anger should be suppressed entirely and forgotten.", "D": "That Jo should prioritize pleasing others over her own feelings.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Marmee is teaching Jo that real strength is found in gentleness and understanding, emphasizing patience and self-control as valuable traits.Choice A is incorrect because Marmee does not advise Jo to hide her emotions entirely; she encourages her to learn patience and self-control. Choice C is incorrect because Marmee does not suggest that Jo suppress her anger completely, but rather that she manage it thoughtfully. Choice D is incorrect because Marmee is focusing on inner strength, not on prioritizing others\u2019 feelings over Jo's own."}
