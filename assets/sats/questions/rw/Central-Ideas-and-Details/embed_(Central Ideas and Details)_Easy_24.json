{"introduction": "The following text is from Middlemarch by George Eliot (1871). Dorothea Brooke is reflecting on her decision to marry Mr. Casaubon, a much older scholar, in the hopes of leading a life of intellectual purpose.", "text": "Dorothea felt that in marrying Mr. Casaubon she was devoting herself to a grand purpose. She believed that her life would be filled with meaning by aiding him in his work, supporting his intellectual pursuits. Yet, as she considered her future, a quiet uncertainty stirred within her. Could she truly find fulfillment in a life of study and scholarship that was not her own? She pushed the thought aside, convincing herself that such a path was noble and worthy.", "question": "Based on the text, how does Dorothea feel about her upcoming marriage to Mr. Casaubon?", "A": "She is primarily interested in Mr. Casaubon\u2019s wealth and status.", "B": "She is excited to embark on a life of independent scholarship.", "C": "She is entirely confident that it will bring her the fulfillment she seeks.", "D": "She feels a mixture of purpose and doubt regarding her choice.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Dorothea experiences a \u201cquiet uncertainty\u201d about her future, suggesting a mixture of purpose and doubt regarding her choice to marry Mr. Casaubon for a life of intellectual pursuit.Choice A is incorrect because, although Dorothea hopes the marriage will bring her fulfillment, she is not entirely confident; she feels some uncertainty. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not mention Mr. Casaubon\u2019s wealth or status as a factor in Dorothea\u2019s decision. Choice D is incorrect because Dorothea\u2019s purpose is to support Mr. Casaubon\u2019s scholarship, not to pursue independent intellectual work."}
