{"introduction": "The following text is from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850). Hester Prynne, the protagonist, reflects on her decision to stay in the Puritan settlement despite the shame she endures.", "text": "Lonely as was Hester\u2019s situation, and without a friend on earth who dared to show her sympathy, she could not bring herself to leave the scene of her guilt and punishment. Her daily life was steeped in quiet endurance; the scarlet letter on her bosom a perpetual reminder of her shame. Yet, she felt a strange sense of connection to the place where her sorrow had taken root, as if her spirit was bound to that dark soil and could not be torn away.", "question": "According to the text, why does Hester choose to stay in the settlement?", "A": "She fears the shame of starting a new life elsewhere.", "B": "She believes she can eventually gain acceptance from the townspeople.", "C": "She feels a deep attachment to the place where her suffering began.", "D": "She is bound by legal obligations that prevent her from leaving.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Hester feels a strange sense of connection to the place where her suffering began, suggesting that she feels attached to the settlement despite her shame.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Hester stays with the hope of being accepted by the townspeople. Choice C is incorrect because her choice to stay is based on a personal attachment, not fear of shame elsewhere. Choice D is incorrect because there is no mention of legal obligations preventing her from leaving; her decision is internal and emotional."}
