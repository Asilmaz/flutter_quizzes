She drew in a deep breath and then whispered to herself, 'It\u2019s even more beautiful than I dreamed!' Marilla, watching her, felt a small pang in her heart. She had never thought of Green Gables in such a way before, and seeing it through Anne\u2019s eyes brought a new appreciation. For the first time, she saw the place as something beyond just a home, but as a place full of wonder and beauty.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "A": "Marilla feels uncertain about her decision to adopt Anne.", "B": "Anne\u2019s excitement helps Marilla see Green Gables in a new way.", "C": "Anne is disappointed because Green Gables is not as she imagined.", "D": "Marilla believes that Green Gables is more suitable for someone else.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Marilla, through observing Anne\u2019s admiration, begins to see Green Gables differently and appreciates it as a place of beauty and wonder.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Marilla is uncertain about adopting Anne; rather, she is simply seeing her surroundings in a new light.
