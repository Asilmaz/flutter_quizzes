	"introduction": "This excerpt is from a historian’s analysis of how certain medieval cities regulated commerce.",
	"text": "Records suggest that city officials restricted trade to designated squares, implementing strict closing hours. Yet some merchants discreetly kept their stalls open at night, forging alliances with local guards to avoid penalties. Over time, such clandestine behavior subverted the city’s attempts at orderly regulation.",
	"question": "Which statement is most strongly supported by the text regarding commerce in these medieval cities?",
	"A": "Official restrictions consistently prevented clandestine market activities.",
	"B": "Merchants who stayed open late had little interest in evading official supervision.",
	"C": "Cooperation between merchants and local guards contributed to undermining official trade regulations.",
	"D": "The city officials broadly permitted commercial activities at any hour to encourage trade.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C accurately reflects how alliances with guards helped merchants defy official rules. A is incorrect because the text shows that some merchants circumvented restrictions. B is incorrect because these merchants did indeed evade supervision. D is opposite of what the passage says: city officials enforced restrictions, not allowances."
