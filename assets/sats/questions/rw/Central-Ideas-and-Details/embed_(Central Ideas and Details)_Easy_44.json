{"introduction": "The following text is from The Jungle by Upton Sinclair (1906). Jurgis Rudkus, an immigrant worker, is witnessing the harsh and unsafe conditions in the meatpacking factories.", "text": "Everywhere he looked, he saw men, women, and even children laboring in dangerous conditions, their faces drawn and weary. The air was thick with the stench of blood and decay, and the floors were slick with filth. Jurgis felt a wave of despair as he watched the workers, knowing that their only reward was barely enough to keep them alive. He realized that this place consumed people, body and soul, leaving them with nothing but exhaustion and misery.", "question": "Based on the text, how does Jurgis feel about the working conditions in the factory?", "A": "He feels indifferent because he believes hard work builds character.", "B": "He admires the resilience of the workers who endure such conditions.", "C": "He feels a sense of despair, realizing the factory dehumanizes its workers.", "D": "He is determined to improve the conditions for himself and others.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Jurgis feels despair as he observes the dehumanizing conditions that leave workers with nothing but exhaustion and misery, highlighting his perception of the factory\u2019s destructive impact on the workers.Choice A is incorrect because Jurgis does not feel indifferent; he is clearly disturbed by what he sees. Choice B is incorrect because there is no indication that Jurgis feels determined to improve the conditions; he feels hopelessness rather than motivation. Choice D is incorrect because, while he observes the workers, there is no mention of admiration; instead, he is saddened by the conditions they endure."}
