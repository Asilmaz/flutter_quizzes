Maggie Tulliver is reflecting on her relationship with her brother Tom and the love and tension that have shaped it.", "text": "Maggie\u2019s heart ached as she thought of Tom\u2019s sternness, his unwavering sense of duty that sometimes felt like a wall between them. She longed for his approval, for a closeness that seemed always just out of reach. Yet, despite his strictness, she couldn\u2019t help but admire his strength and loyalty. Even when they argued, her love for him remained, steady and unchanging, like the river that ran through their childhood home.", "question": "What does Maggie\u2019s reflection suggest about her feelings toward Tom?", "A": "She feels indifferent to Tom\u2019s opinions and doesn\u2019t seek his approval.", "B": "She resents Tom deeply for his strictness and feels no affection for him.", "C": "She believes Tom is entirely responsible for the distance between them.", "D": "She admires Tom\u2019s strength and loyalty, even though his sternness causes her pain.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Maggie feels both admiration for Tom\u2019s strength and loyalty and a desire for his approval, even though his strictness sometimes causes her pain.Choice A is incorrect because Maggie does not resent Tom; she loves and admires him despite his sternness. Choice C is incorrect because Maggie is not indifferent; she deeply values Tom\u2019s approval.
