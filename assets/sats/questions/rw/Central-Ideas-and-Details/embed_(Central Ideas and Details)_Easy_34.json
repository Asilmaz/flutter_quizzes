{"introduction": "The following text is from To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (1960). Scout Finch is recalling a lesson her father, Atticus, taught her about understanding other people.", "text": "Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was enough. I had never seen our neighborhood from this angle before, and it gave me a new view of the people in it. From here, I could understand why they acted as they did, why they held the opinions they did, and maybe even why they were sometimes afraid.", "question": "What does Scout realize as she stands on the Radley porch?", "A": "She understands that she will never truly know her neighbors.", "B": "She decides that it is best to remain distant from her neighbors.", "C": "She realizes that her father\u2019s lesson about empathy was incorrect.", "D": "She gains insight into the perspective and behavior of others.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Scout\u2019s reflection on her father\u2019s lesson about standing in someone else\u2019s shoes leads her to gain insight into others' perspectives, understanding why people act as they do.Choice A is incorrect because Scout is actually gaining understanding of her neighbors, not realizing she will never know them. Choice C is incorrect because she reaffirms her father\u2019s lesson, finding it correct and meaningful. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that she wants to stay distant; rather, she is developing empathy for others."}
