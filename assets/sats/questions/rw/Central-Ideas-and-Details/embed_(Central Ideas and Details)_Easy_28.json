{"introduction": "The following text is from David Copperfield by Charles Dickens (1850). David is describing his Aunt Betsey\u2019s careful management of her household and her tendency to take on responsibilities herself.", "text": "My aunt was as thoroughly neat and orderly as possible, and as much of a manager as ever. It was a sight to see her put her household through its paces, and to see how even little matters would come under her close inspection. No sooner was a thing done in her house than it was done over again, if she suspected any inattention to her orders. Her eye was everywhere, and she seemed to take pride in leaving nothing to chance.", "question": "According to the text, what would most likely happen if Aunt Betsey felt that a task was not done to her standards?", "A": "She would take it upon herself to redo the task.", "B": "She would delegate the task to another household member.", "C": "She would decide that the task was not worth her time.", "D": "She would dismiss the person responsible for the task.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because the text states that if Aunt Betsey suspected any inattention, she would ensure the task was \u201cdone over again,\u201d indicating she would likely redo it to meet her standards.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Aunt Betsey would dismiss anyone; she is more focused on ensuring tasks are completed to her satisfaction. Choice C is incorrect because Aunt Betsey values even little matters, suggesting she would not dismiss tasks as unimportant. Choice D is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Aunt Betsey\u2019s hands-on approach rather than delegating responsibilities to others."}
