	"introduction": "An extract from a historian’s account of maritime trade routes in the late medieval era.",
	"text": "Though pirates posed a constant threat, merchants continued to risk passage through the straits, lured by lucrative markets on the opposite shore. Over time, these threats shaped not only the design of ships—heavier hulls and reinforced decks—but also the political alliances, as regions pooled naval resources to curb piracy.",
	"question": "According to the text, what was one significant consequence of piracy in the straits?",
	"A": "Merchants abandoned maritime trade altogether for inland routes.",
	"B": "Shipbuilding technology advanced, and defensive cooperation among regions grew.",
	"C": "Merchants decided to surrender to pirates to negotiate peaceful travel.",
	"D": "All trade in the region completely ceased due to high risks.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B reflects how piracy led to sturdier ships and spurred alliances to combat the threats. A is contradicted; trade persisted. C is never mentioned. D is also contradicted by the ongoing trade described."
