{"introduction": "The following text is from Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne (1872). Phileas Fogg, an English gentleman, has made a wager that he can travel around the world in eighty days.", "text": "The idea of traveling around the world in such a short time seemed nearly impossible to everyone who heard it. Yet, Mr. Fogg, with his calm and unyielding confidence, believed it could be done. With only a few essentials packed, he set off on his journey with his loyal servant, Passepartout. Determined and unfazed by the challenges he might face, Mr. Fogg knew that his success depended not only on speed but on maintaining a precise and unrelenting schedule.", "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?", "A": "Mr. Fogg\u2019s journey is widely supported by those around him.", "B": "The journey requires an enormous amount of supplies and resources.", "C": "Mr. Fogg\u2019s confidence and planning are crucial to his attempt.", "D": "Passepartout is uncertain about Mr. Fogg\u2019s travel plans.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because the text emphasizes Mr. Fogg\u2019s calm confidence and determination to stick to a strict schedule, which are presented as essential to his plan for success.Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that others support Mr. Fogg\u2019s journey; rather, it seems most people doubt the feasibility of his plan. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention any uncertainty from Passepartout about Mr. Fogg\u2019s plans. Choice D is incorrect because the passage suggests that Mr. Fogg only brings a few essentials, so extensive supplies and resources are not a focus."}
