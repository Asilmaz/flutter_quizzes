{"introduction": "The following text is from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray is confronted by the changes in his portrait, which reflect the corruption of his soul, while he himself remains outwardly unchanged.", "text": "Dorian stared at the portrait, horrified by the twisted reflection staring back at him. Every line of cruelty and selfishness was etched into the canvas, while his own face remained as youthful as ever. He felt a pang of guilt, but it was quickly overshadowed by a strange fascination. It was as if the portrait bore all the weight of his sins, freeing him to live as he pleased, yet something about it left him unsettled and unable to look away.", "question": "What does Dorian\u2019s reaction to the portrait reveal about his feelings toward his actions?", "A": "He feels completely ashamed and immediately vows to change his ways.", "B": "He feels proud of his actions and wishes to continue living without restraint.", "C": "He is indifferent to the portrait\u2019s changes and barely acknowledges them.", "D": "He feels a mixture of guilt and fascination, unable to ignore the effects of his actions.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Dorian feels a pang of guilt but also a strange fascination, showing he is both disturbed by and attracted to the effects of his actions as reflected in the portrait.Choice A is incorrect because, although Dorian feels some fascination, he is not entirely proud; he feels guilt as well. Choice C is incorrect because Dorian is not indifferent; he is deeply affected by the changes in the portrait. Choice D is incorrect because Dorian does not immediately vow to change; he is conflicted, feeling both guilt and intrigue."}
