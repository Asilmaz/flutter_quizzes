{"introduction": "The following text is from The Portrait of a Lady by Henry James (1881). Isabel Archer is reflecting on her newfound independence after arriving in Europe, where she hopes to make her own choices.", "text": "Isabel stood at the window, looking out at the city with a sense of exhilaration and unease. She had come so far to embrace freedom, to live a life shaped by her own decisions. But as she gazed at the unfamiliar streets, a quiet fear lingered beneath her excitement. The path she had chosen was hers alone, with no one to guide her, no familiar hand to hold. She realized that freedom came with risks and that she would need courage to face the unknown.", "question": "What does Isabel\u2019s reflection reveal about her feelings toward her independence?", "A": "She regrets her decision to seek independence and wishes to return home.", "B": "She feels entirely confident in her independence and has no fear.", "C": "She feels excited about her independence but also apprehensive about the challenges it brings.", "D": "She is indifferent to her independence and does not consider the consequences.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Isabel feels both exhilaration and unease as she contemplates her independence, indicating excitement but also a level of apprehension about the risks involved.Choice A is incorrect because Isabel does feel fear and unease; she is not entirely confident. Choice C is incorrect because she does not express regret or a desire to return home; she still values her independence. Choice D is incorrect because Isabel is far from indifferent; she is deeply aware of and affected by the weight of her choices."}
