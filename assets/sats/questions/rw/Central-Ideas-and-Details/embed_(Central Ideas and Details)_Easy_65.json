{"introduction": "The following text is from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway is observing Gatsby during one of his extravagant parties.", "text": "Gatsby stood apart from the crowd, his face thoughtful and distant, as if he were waiting for something that no amount of music or laughter could bring him. There was a restlessness in his gaze, a quiet yearning that seemed out of place among the revelers surrounding him. Nick wondered if Gatsby, despite his wealth and charm, was perhaps the loneliest person in the room.", "question": "What does Nick\u2019s observation suggest about Gatsby\u2019s feelings during the party?", "A": "Gatsby is frustrated by the lack of attention he receives from his guests.", "B": "Gatsby feels completely satisfied and fulfilled with his life.", "C": "Gatsby seems disconnected from the party, as if he is searching for something more.", "D": "Gatsby is excited by the party atmosphere and eager to join in.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Nick describes Gatsby as thoughtful and distant and filled with a quiet yearning, indicating that Gatsby feels disconnected and is searching for something deeper or more meaningful.Choice A is incorrect because Gatsby does not feel satisfied; he appears restless and unfulfilled. Choice C is incorrect because Gatsby does not seem excited or eager to join in; he stands apart, observing rather than participating. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Gatsby is frustrated about attention from others; his detachment seems to stem from an inner longing."}
