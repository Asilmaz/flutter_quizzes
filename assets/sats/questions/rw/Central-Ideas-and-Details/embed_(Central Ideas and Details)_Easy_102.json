Newland Archer is considering his feelings for Ellen Olenska, who lives with an independence that challenges the rigid social norms he has always known.", "text": "Newland watched Ellen with a mixture of admiration and envy. Her life seemed so free, so untouched by the strict rules that defined his own. He longed to be near her, drawn by her fearless rejection of society\u2019s limitations, yet he felt a pull back to his obligations and his role in the world he had always known. It was as though he stood on the edge of two worlds, each one calling him in a different direction.", "question": "What does Newland\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward Ellen\u2019s independence?", "A": "He feels threatened by Ellen\u2019s lifestyle and wishes to avoid her.", "B": "He is indifferent to Ellen\u2019s choices and remains unaffected by her influence.", "C": "He admires Ellen\u2019s independence but feels torn between her and his own obligations.", "D": "He disapproves of Ellen\u2019s rejection of society and seeks to change her.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Newland admires Ellen\u2019s independence but feels a pull back to his obligations, indicating he is torn between his attraction to her freedom and his loyalty to societal expectations.Choice A is incorrect because Newland does not feel threatened; he admires Ellen\u2019s independence.
