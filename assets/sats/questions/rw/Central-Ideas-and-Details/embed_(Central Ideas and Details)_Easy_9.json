Nearby, his friends Huck and Joe were skipping stones across the water, their laughter echoing through the warm afternoon air. The river flowed lazily beside them, glinting under the golden light. The boys felt free, untethered by the cares of school or chores, as if the whole world belonged to them and this moment would never end.", "question": "Which choice best describes what is happening in the text?", "A": "Tom and his friends are troubled by the responsibilities they face back home.", "B": "Tom and his friends are preparing for an important event by the river.", "C": "Tom and his friends are playing near the river, enjoying a carefree afternoon.", "D": "Tom is alone by the river, lost in deep thought about his life.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "A is the best answer because the text describes Tom and his friends laughing, skipping stones, and feeling \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cuntethered\u201d by responsibilities, indicating they are simply enjoying a carefree afternoon by the river.Choice B is incorrect because there is no indication that Tom and his friends are preparing for anything important; they are relaxing and playing.
