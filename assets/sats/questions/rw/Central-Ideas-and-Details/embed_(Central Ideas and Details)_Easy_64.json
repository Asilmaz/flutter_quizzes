Jane is reflecting on her complex feelings after meeting Mr. Rochester, her employer.", "text": "As I left the room, a strange warmth lingered in my chest, mingled with an unease I could not shake. Mr. Rochester\u2019s presence was powerful, almost magnetic, and I found myself drawn to him in a way I did not fully understand. And yet, I felt a caution as well, as if I must guard myself against that very attraction. It was a new sensation for me, this mixture of curiosity and apprehension, and I wondered what it might mean.", "question": "What does Jane\u2019s reaction to Mr. Rochester suggest about her feelings toward him?", "A": "She feels deeply attracted to him but is also cautious.", "B": "She is entirely indifferent to him and feels no attraction.", "C": "She feels intimidated by him and avoids his presence.", "D": "She is eager to impress him and hopes for his approval.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Jane feels drawn to Mr. Rochester with curiosity and apprehension, indicating both attraction and caution.Choice A is incorrect because Jane is not indifferent; she feels a strong attraction and curiosity. Choice C is incorrect because, while she feels some unease, she is not intimidated to the point of avoidance.
