{"introduction": "The following text is from The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton (1920). Newland Archer reflects on his engagement to May Welland and the societal expectations surrounding their future together.", "text": "Newland felt the weight of his engagement pressing down on him, not because of any flaw in May, but because of the life their union represented. He had always followed society\u2019s expectations without question, but now, as he stood on the threshold of marriage, he felt a stirring of doubt. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care for May; he did. But he found himself wondering if the life he was about to lead was truly his own choice or one that had been chosen for him long ago.", "question": "What does Newland\u2019s reflection reveal about his feelings toward his engagement to May?", "A": "He feels indifferent about his engagement and simply follows society\u2019s expectations without concern.", "B": "He regrets his engagement to May and plans to end it.", "C": "He cares for May but questions whether his engagement aligns with his true desires.", "D": "He feels completely satisfied with his engagement and looks forward to his future with May.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Newland cares for May but feels a stirring of doubt, suggesting he is questioning whether this path aligns with his true desires or is simply dictated by societal expectations.Choice A is incorrect because Newland is not entirely satisfied; he feels some doubt. Choice C is incorrect because he is not indifferent; he is deeply reflective about his choice. Choice D is incorrect because he does not regret his engagement or plan to end it; he is simply questioning the role of societal expectations."}
