	"introduction": "Taken from a political scientist’s examination of policy implementation in rapidly changing economies.",
	"text": "While high-level directives can set ambitious targets, these goals often languish without robust mid-level administration. Ironically, local agencies, despite being closest to on-the-ground realities, receive the least guidance. This mismatch frequently halts progress before it begins.",
	"question": "Which outcome does the text imply results from inadequate coordination between policy directives and local agencies?",
	"A": "Faster achievement of ambitious goals",
	"B": "Greater clarity for mid-level administration",
	"C": "A stall in the successful realization of policy initiatives",
	"D": "An immediate improvement in policy outcomes",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because the passage states that this mismatch ‘halts progress.’ A and D are opposite outcomes of halting progress, and B is also contradicted by the text, which states that local agencies receive the least guidance."
