{"introduction": "The following text is from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne (1870). Captain Nemo, aboard the submarine Nautilus, explains the challenges of traveling in the deep ocean.", "text": "The sea, at a depth of five miles, exerts a pressure of hundreds of atmospheres, which no known material can withstand. It is an impenetrable barrier for ordinary vessels, which would be crushed like an eggshell. The Nautilus, however, was built to endure the incredible forces of the deep, allowing us to explore realms that other ships could never reach. It is a marvel of science and engineering, a fortress beneath the waves.", "question": "According to the text, why can the <em>Nautilus</em> explore areas of the ocean that other vessels cannot?", "A": "It is designed to withstand the high pressures found in deep ocean areas.", "B": "It is powered by an unlimited energy source, allowing for long journeys.", "C": "It is faster than any other vessel, allowing it to reach new areas quickly.", "D": "It uses advanced navigation systems that other ships do not have.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because the text explains that the Nautilus was specifically built to withstand the incredible forces of the deep, which is why it can explore areas that would crush ordinary vessels.Choice A is incorrect because the text does not mention the Nautilus being faster than other vessels; instead, it focuses on the submarine's durability. Choice C is incorrect because, while the Nautilus may have advanced technology, the text does not mention navigation systems as the reason for its unique capabilities. Choice D is incorrect because, although Captain Nemo\u2019s submarine is remarkable, the text does not indicate that an unlimited energy source is what enables it to withstand deep-sea pressures."}
