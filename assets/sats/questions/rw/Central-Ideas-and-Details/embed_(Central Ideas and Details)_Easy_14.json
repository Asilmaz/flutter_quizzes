{"introduction": "The following text is from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Catherine Earnshaw is reflecting on her feelings about her home and her wild surroundings.", "text": "I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is, or should be, an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.", "question": "Which choice best describes Catherine\u2019s feelings about her connection to Heathcliff?", "A": "She believes Heathcliff's presence prevents her from finding happiness.", "B": "She fears that Heathcliff will be forgotten by others if she leaves.", "C": "She feels her identity is deeply connected to Heathcliff\u2019s existence.", "D": "She worries that her love for Heathcliff makes her life difficult.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "A is the best answer because Catherine expresses that her identity and existence are intertwined with Heathcliff\u2019s, as she says that if he were gone, she would no longer feel connected to the world.Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Catherine fears Heathcliff will be forgotten by others; instead, her thoughts focus on her personal connection to him. Choice C is incorrect because, while Catherine acknowledges difficulties, she does not directly attribute them to her love for Heathcliff. Choice D is incorrect because she does not imply that Heathcliff\u2019s presence is a barrier to her happiness; rather, he is central to her sense of self."}
