	"introduction": "An excerpt from a 19th-century naturalist’s diary recounting observations in a tropical rainforest.",
	"text": "Beneath the emerald canopy, I discovered a species of orchid whose petals glistened like glass. The tribespeople guiding me insisted that touching the flower at dawn bestows foresight in matters of weather. While skeptical, I couldn’t help but feel a subtle reverence for their age-old lore.",
	"question": "Which choice best describes the narrator’s reaction to the tribespeople’s beliefs?",
	"A": "Open admiration and complete acceptance of their claim",
	"B": "Skeptical curiosity mixed with respect for the local tradition",
	"C": "Outright dismissal of the possibility that the lore holds any truth",
	"D": "Immediate eagerness to publish the findings in scientific journals",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B matches the narrator’s admitted skepticism paired with reverence for the lore. A is too strong; the narrator remains somewhat doubtful. C is incorrect because the narrator does not dismiss it entirely. D is not mentioned in the text."
