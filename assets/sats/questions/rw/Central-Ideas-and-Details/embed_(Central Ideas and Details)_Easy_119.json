{"introduction": "The following text is from Middlemarch by George Eliot (1871). Dorothea Brooke reflects on her marriage to Mr. Casaubon, realizing that it has not fulfilled her hopes for a partnership of shared ideas and purpose.", "text": "Dorothea sat alone in the library, her heart heavy as she thought of her life with Mr. Casaubon. She had dreamed of a marriage where she could grow and learn alongside a true companion, but instead, she found herself isolated and stifled by his narrow ambitions. The intellectual life she had imagined was now overshadowed by a sense of duty and disappointment. She began to wonder if she had mistaken her own hopes for what was truly possible.", "question": "What does Dorothea\u2019s reflection suggest about her feelings toward her marriage?", "A": "She feels disappointed and isolated, realizing her marriage lacks the partnership she had hoped for.", "B": "She feels grateful for her marriage and is content to support Mr. Casaubon\u2019s work.", "C": "She feels indifferent to her marriage and finds it unimportant in her life.", "D": "She feels fulfilled and inspired by the intellectual companionship in her marriage.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer because Dorothea feels isolated and stifled rather than intellectually fulfilled, suggesting disappointment in her marriage, which lacks the partnership she had once hoped for.Choice A is incorrect because Dorothea does not feel fulfilled; she feels the opposite. Choice C is incorrect because she is not content or grateful; she feels disappointed. Choice D is incorrect because she is not indifferent; she is deeply affected by the shortcomings of her marriage."}
