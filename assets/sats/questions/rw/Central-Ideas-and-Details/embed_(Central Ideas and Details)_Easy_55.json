{"introduction": "The following text is from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain (1884). Huck is reflecting on his decision to help Jim, an escaped slave, despite what society has taught him.", "text": "I couldn\u2019t get it out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn\u2019t rest; I couldn\u2019t stay still in my chair, and I couldn\u2019t sleep. It was because I was raised to see Jim as property, to feel that I was doing wrong by helping him. But somehow, deep down, I just knew I couldn\u2019t let him be caught and taken back. I figured it made me wicked, but I decided I\u2019d rather be wicked than turn him in.", "question": "What does Huck\u2019s internal conflict reveal about his character?", "A": "He feels proud of himself for going against society\u2019s rules.", "B": "He values his friendship with Jim more than society\u2019s expectations.", "C": "He believes that helping Jim is the right thing, without any doubts.", "D": "He is uncertain about Jim\u2019s escape and considers betraying him.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "C is the best answer because Huck chooses to help Jim despite believing that society\u2019s teachings make him \u201cwicked\u201d for doing so, which shows he values their friendship over societal expectations.Choice A is incorrect because Huck does not feel proud; he believes he is wicked for going against what he has been taught. Choice B is incorrect because, although Huck is troubled, he ultimately chooses not to betray Jim. Choice D is incorrect because Huck has doubts and feels conflicted, even as he decides to help Jim."}
