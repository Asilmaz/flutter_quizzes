{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair and initially faced harsh criticism for its unconventional design, with many calling it an eyesore. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. Despite the initial negative reaction, the Eiffel Tower has since become one of the most recognizable structures globally, symbolizing Paris\u2019s architectural innovation and cultural significance. The Eiffel Tower also has practical uses, serving as a radio and television transmission tower, which contributed to its ongoing importance in modern communication. Today, it is one of the most visited paid monuments worldwide, attracting millions of tourists annually who come to admire its design and panoramic views of the city.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural and engineering significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, initially criticized for its unconventional design, has become a symbol of Paris\u2019s innovation in architecture and engineering, representing a significant achievement in both fields.", "B": "Despite initial criticism, the Eiffel Tower continues to symbolize Paris\u2019s architectural and engineering innovation, with its unique design now regarded as an iconic masterpiece.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 and standing at 1,083 feet tall, is one of the most iconic structures in the world, symbolizing Paris\u2019s strength in engineering and architectural creativity.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, standing at 1,083 feet tall, was initially controversial but has since become a symbol of Paris\u2019s architectural brilliance, admired for its unique design and engineering feats.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice B is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural and engineering significance. It mentions its innovative design and engineering feats, which align with the student\u2019s goal of highlighting the tower's importance in these fields. Choice A is incorrect because, while it highlights architectural innovation, it doesn\u2019t provide as much emphasis on the tower\u2019s engineering aspects as  Choice B does. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses more on the tower\u2019s iconic status and symbolism rather than its specific architectural and engineering achievements. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes the symbolic aspects of the tower without sufficiently detailing its architectural and engineering contributions."}
