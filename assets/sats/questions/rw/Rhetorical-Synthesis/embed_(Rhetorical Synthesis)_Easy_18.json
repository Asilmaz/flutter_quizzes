{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The tundra is a unique and harsh environment characterized by cold temperatures and minimal precipitation. Winter temperatures in the tundra can reach as low as -30 degrees Fahrenheit, making it one of the coldest regions on Earth. Despite its extreme climate, the tundra is home to over 1,700 species of plants and animals, many of which have adapted to survive its conditions. The tundra\u2019s short growing season is crucial for plant life, with temperatures rising to a mild 54 degrees Fahrenheit during summer months. Animals that thrive in the tundra, such as the Arctic fox and caribou, have specialized adaptations to cope with the cold and lack of food during winter.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the harshness of the tundra\u2019s winter conditions. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The tundra is home to over 1,700 species of plants and animals, many of which are adapted to survive extreme cold temperatures.", "B": "Winters in the tundra are especially harsh, with temperatures averaging as low as -30 degrees Fahrenheit, one of the coldest climates on Earth.", "C": "Despite its short growing season, the tundra supports a variety of plants and animals that thrive in the region\u2019s unique climate.", "D": "The tundra\u2019s extreme winter conditions, with temperatures as low as -30 degrees Fahrenheit, challenge the survival of many plant and animal species.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the harshness of the tundra\u2019s winter conditions, mentioning the extremely low temperatures as one of the coldest regions on Earth. Choice B is incorrect because it highlights the adaptation of species to the tundra\u2019s conditions but doesn\u2019t focus on the harshness of the winter. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the overall climate and thriving species but not specifically on the harshness of the winter. Choice D is incorrect because while it mentions the extreme winter temperatures, it does not emphasize how cold the tundra is relative to other climates."}
