{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Azores is an archipelago located about 870 miles off the coast of Portugal in the North Atlantic Ocean. Historians have long believed that Portuguese mariners were the first to populate the Azores in the fifteenth century. However, a 2015 study led by Sofia Gabriel and Maria da Luz Mathias found evidence suggesting that Vikings may have reached the Azores as early as the ninth century. This study revealed a genetic link between house mice in the Azores and house mice in Scandinavia, supporting the theory that Vikings may have brought the mice with them on their ships.", "question": "The student wants to specify who might have first populated the Azores according to the 2015 study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The 2015 study reveals that the Azores may have been populated by Vikings, a discovery that challenges the previous belief that Portuguese mariners were the first to arrive.", "B": "Historians have long believed that Portuguese mariners were the first to populate the Azores, but recent studies suggest the Vikings may have arrived earlier.", "C": "The 2015 study found that house mice from Scandinavia had a genetic connection to house mice in the Azores, which could indicate early Viking presence.", "D": "According to a 2015 study, Vikings from Scandinavia may have been the first humans to populate the Azores, not Portuguese mariners as previously believed.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly specifies that the 2015 study suggests Vikings, not Portuguese mariners, were the first to populate the Azores. Choice B is incorrect because it introduces the historical belief about the Portuguese without focusing on the study\u2019s conclusion regarding the Vikings. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the evidence related to house mice but does not directly answer the question about who first populated the Azores. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the Viking theory but doesn\u2019t provide the clarity offered by the study\u2019s conclusion, which specifically identifies Vikings as the potential first settlers."}
