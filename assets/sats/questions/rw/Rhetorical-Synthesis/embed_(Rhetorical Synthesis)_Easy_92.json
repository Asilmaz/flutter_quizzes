{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile-long waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, drastically reducing the travel distance for ships. This engineering marvel has been vital for global trade, enabling ships to avoid the long and hazardous journey around the southern tip of South America. Initially controlled by the United States, the canal was transferred to Panama in 1999 as part of the Panama Canal Treaty, granting Panama full control over the waterway. The canal has been expanded over the years to accommodate larger ships, with the <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em> project completed in 2016. In addition to its economic importance, the canal has strategic significance, facilitating the movement of goods and resources across international waters.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Panama Canal\u2019s impact on global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal has played a crucial role in global trade by significantly shortening shipping routes, allowing goods to move more efficiently between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "B": "The Panama Canal, stretching over 51 miles, is essential to global trade by providing a shortcut for ships and facilitating the transport of goods between continents.", "C": "Completed in 1914 and expanded in 2016, the Panama Canal is a vital waterway that has improved global shipping efficiency by connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "D": "The Panama Canal, initially under U.S. control and later transferred to Panama, serves as a major global trade route, reducing the time it takes to ship goods between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly focuses on the Panama Canal\u2019s impact on global trade, emphasizing how it shortens shipping routes and improves efficiency, which is central to the student\u2019s goal. Choice B is incorrect because while it mentions the canal\u2019s function as a shortcut, it does not highlight its broader impact on global trade efficiency and effectiveness as clearly as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses more on the completion and expansion of the canal, rather than how those developments specifically impacted global trade. Choice D is incorrect because it mentions the canal\u2019s political history but does not emphasize its direct effect on trade routes as clearly as  Choice A."}
