{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon River, located in South America, is the second-longest river in the world, stretching over 4,000 miles from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. It drains an area of 2.7 million square miles, making it the largest river basin in the world. The Amazon River is home to an extraordinary variety of wildlife, including species of fish, mammals, birds, and reptiles found nowhere else on Earth. In addition to its ecological significance, the river plays a critical role in regulating the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. The Amazon faces significant environmental threats, including deforestation and pollution, which are putting its biodiversity and its climate-regulating role in jeopardy.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Amazon River\u2019s environmental importance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Stretching over 4,000 miles, the Amazon River is a vital waterway that not only supports biodiversity but also helps in regulating the global climate by producing oxygen.", "B": "The Amazon River, home to diverse species of wildlife, plays a critical role in the environment by supporting biodiversity and regulating the global climate.", "C": "The Amazon River is essential for global climate regulation, as it absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, helping stabilize the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.", "D": "The Amazon River basin, draining 2.7 million square miles, faces significant environmental threats, including deforestation and pollution, which jeopardize its biodiversity.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly focuses on the Amazon River's role in regulating the global climate, particularly its ability to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, which are central to its environmental importance. Choice B is incorrect because it emphasizes biodiversity without focusing enough on the Amazon\u2019s climate-regulating function. Choice C is incorrect because it mentions climate regulation but doesn\u2019t explain the specific role of the Amazon in absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen as clearly as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on threats to the Amazon rather than its positive environmental role."}
