{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles). The reef is home to an incredible variety of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and numerous other organisms, many of which are unique to the reef. The Great Barrier Reef plays a vital role in maintaining marine biodiversity and provides essential services to ecosystems across the globe. In addition to its ecological importance, the reef supports the Australian economy through tourism and fishing, attracting millions of visitors every year. However, the reef is under serious threat due to climate change, pollution, and coral bleaching, which have already caused significant damage to its ecosystem.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the ecological importance of the Great Barrier Reef. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Barrier Reef, stretching over 2,300 kilometers, is a major tourist attraction and supports Australia\u2019s economy through fishing and tourism industries.", "B": "The Great Barrier Reef is vital for global marine biodiversity, providing habitats for over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and numerous other organisms unique to its ecosystem.", "C": "Despite threats from climate change and pollution, the Great Barrier Reef remains a vital ecosystem that sustains biodiversity and provides global ecological benefits.", "D": "The Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef system in the world, plays an essential role in both supporting marine life and contributing to Australia\u2019s tourism economy.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it highlights the ecological significance of the Great Barrier Reef, emphasizing its role in supporting marine biodiversity and providing habitats for numerous species. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions tourism and the economy, it doesn\u2019t focus enough on the reef\u2019s ecological importance. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses more on the threats to the reef than on its specific ecological role in maintaining biodiversity. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses both ecological and economic aspects but doesn\u2019t emphasize the biodiversity and ecological importance as clearly as  Choice A."}
