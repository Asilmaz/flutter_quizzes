{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is one of the most impressive feats of engineering in history, originally built to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes. Construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BCE, with various sections built by different Chinese dynasties, including the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. The wall is made from a variety of materials, such as earth, wood, and brick, and its design adapted to the various terrains it passed through, from deserts to mountains. While it served as a military defense for many centuries, the Great Wall\u2019s role has evolved, and it now stands as a symbol of China\u2019s strength and resilience. The wall also helped control trade and immigration along the Silk Road, contributing to the economic and cultural exchange between China and other regions.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Great Wall\u2019s military purpose. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, was primarily used as a defense system but also served as a cultural symbol of resilience and strength for the Chinese people.", "B": "The Great Wall of China, constructed by various dynasties, served as a military defense system and symbol of strength, protecting China from northern invaders.", "C": "The Great Wall\u2019s design, which included passageways and watchtowers, was essential in controlling trade and immigration along the Silk Road, contributing to China\u2019s economy.", "D": "The Great Wall of China was built primarily to defend against invasions by nomadic tribes, serving as a military defense system that adapted to different terrains.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly addresses the Great Wall\u2019s primary military purpose: defending against invasions, and it highlights how the wall adapted to the different terrains it passed through. Choice B is incorrect because, although it discusses the military purpose, it also emphasizes the wall\u2019s symbolic role, which is less relevant to the student\u2019s focus on its military function. Choice C is incorrect because it shifts focus to the Great Wall\u2019s role in trade and immigration, which is not the student\u2019s main focus of military defense. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses both the military and symbolic aspects of the wall but doesn\u2019t emphasize its military function as clearly as  Choice A."}
