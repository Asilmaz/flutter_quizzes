{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, was originally built to protect the northern borders of China from invasions by nomadic tribes, particularly the Mongols. Construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BCE, with different sections being built by various dynasties, including the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. Made from a variety of materials, such as earth, wood, and brick, the wall's design adapted to the various terrains it passed through, from deserts to mountains. The Great Wall is often considered a symbol of Chinese strength and perseverance, as it represents the determination of the Chinese people to defend their land. Today, the Great Wall is one of the most visited landmarks in the world, attracting millions of tourists who come to admire its scale, history, and cultural significance.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Great Wall\u2019s military purpose. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is a powerful symbol of China\u2019s strength and resilience, originally constructed to defend the empire from northern invaders.", "B": "The Great Wall of China was built to protect against invasions by nomadic tribes, serving as a military defense system that adapted to the varied terrains it passed through.", "C": "Made from a variety of materials, the Great Wall of China was constructed to serve as a military defense, protecting China from invasions and symbolizing national perseverance.", "D": "The Great Wall of China, originally built by different dynasties, remains one of the most iconic symbols of China\u2019s military strength and cultural heritage.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly addresses the Great Wall's military purpose, focusing on its role as a defense against invasions, and highlights its design adaptation to different terrains, which is central to its function. Choice B is incorrect because while it mentions defense and strength, it emphasizes symbolism over the wall's direct military function. Choice C is incorrect because it includes a focus on materials and symbolism, but it doesn\u2019t emphasize the wall\u2019s role as a military defense system as clearly as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses too much on the wall's symbolic meaning and does not adequately address its military function."}
