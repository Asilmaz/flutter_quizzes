{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles). The reef is home to thousands of marine species, including over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and other organisms essential to the marine ecosystem. The Great Barrier Reef plays a significant role in protecting coastal areas by acting as a natural barrier against storms and waves, reducing erosion and damage to shorelines. In addition to its ecological importance, the reef attracts millions of tourists each year, contributing billions of dollars to Australia\u2019s economy. However, the reef faces threats from climate change, including rising sea temperatures and coral bleaching, which endanger its survival and biodiversity.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecological significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Barrier Reef acts as a natural barrier that protects coastal areas from storms and waves, playing an important role in reducing erosion and storm damage.", "B": "The Great Barrier Reef, spanning over 2,300 kilometers, is the largest coral reef system in the world and a major tourist attraction contributing to Australia\u2019s economy.", "C": "The Great Barrier Reef is vital for marine ecosystems, supporting thousands of species, including fish, coral, and other organisms that rely on its unique habitat.", "D": "Despite facing threats from climate change, the Great Barrier Reef remains a key marine ecosystem and one of the world\u2019s most visited natural landmarks.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it emphasizes the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecological importance, specifically its role in supporting marine ecosystems and thousands of species that depend on its unique habitat. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses more on the reef\u2019s size and economic contributions rather than its ecological significance. Choice C is incorrect because it highlights the reef\u2019s role in coastal protection but does not address its broader ecological role in supporting marine biodiversity. Choice D is incorrect because it mentions threats to the reef and its status as a tourist destination without focusing on its ecological importance."}
