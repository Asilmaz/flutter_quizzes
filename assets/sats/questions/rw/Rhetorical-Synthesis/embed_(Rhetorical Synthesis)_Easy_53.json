{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Isthmus of Panama. The canal has been critical for global trade, saving ships from the long journey around South America, allowing for faster and more efficient shipping. The canal was initially controlled by the United States, but in 1999, control was handed over to Panama under the Panama Canal Treaty. In addition to its economic impact, the canal has strategic geopolitical significance, as it provides a shortcut for international shipping routes. The Panama Canal has been expanded over the years to accommodate larger vessels, including the <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em> project, which was completed in 2016.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Panama Canal\u2019s role in global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal is essential to global trade, providing a shortcut that saves ships from navigating around South America, making international shipping faster and more efficient.", "B": "The Panama Canal has been expanded and modernized over the years, including the 2016 <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em>, which allowed it to accommodate larger vessels.", "C": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and has been critical for international trade by shortening shipping routes.", "D": "The Panama Canal\u2019s strategic significance, coupled with its economic impact, has made it one of the most important structures in global shipping, especially after the 1999 handover to Panama.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Panama Canal\u2019s key role in global trade, specifically its function in shortening shipping routes and making international trade more efficient. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the canal\u2019s expansion but does not emphasize its primary role in facilitating global trade. Choice C is incorrect because while it mentions the canal\u2019s function and significance, it doesn\u2019t highlight its impact on trade as clearly as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the canal's geopolitical and economic importance without directly addressing its role in global trade."}
