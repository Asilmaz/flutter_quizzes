{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the largest coral reef system in the world, stretching over 1,430 miles. It is home to a diverse array of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and a wide variety of other organisms, making it one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. The reef plays a crucial role in supporting the marine food chain, providing food and shelter to many species of fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals. The Great Barrier Reef is also important for tourism, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to dive, snorkel, and explore its rich marine life. However, the reef is under threat due to climate change, coral bleaching, and pollution, which have led to significant damage in recent years.", "question": "The student wants to highlight the ecological importance of the Great Barrier Reef. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Barrier Reef, home to thousands of species, plays a crucial role in supporting the marine food chain, providing essential food and shelter for a wide range of marine organisms.", "B": "The Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef system in the world, stretches over 1,430 miles and is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.", "C": "The Great Barrier Reef is not only a major tourist attraction but also plays a significant role in sustaining marine life by providing shelter and food for many species.", "D": "The Great Barrier Reef is facing significant damage due to climate change and pollution, threatening its biodiversity and ecological functions.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecological importance by highlighting its role in supporting the marine food chain and providing shelter and food for a variety of species. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the reef\u2019s size and biodiversity, it doesn\u2019t emphasize its ecological role in supporting the marine food chain. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses more on tourism and the reef\u2019s general role in sustaining marine life, without specifically addressing its ecological importance. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the threats to the reef rather than highlighting its positive ecological contributions."}
