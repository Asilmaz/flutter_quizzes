{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the largest coral reef system in the world, covering about 2,700 kilometers (1,678 miles). It is home to a staggering variety of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and thousands of other organisms. The reef is vital to the health of the oceans, helping regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. The Great Barrier Reef is also a major contributor to the Australian economy, with tourism being one of the leading industries, attracting millions of visitors each year. However, the reef is under threat due to climate change, pollution, and overfishing, which have led to widespread coral bleaching and habitat destruction.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecological significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Barrier Reef, spanning over 1,600 miles, is a key tourist destination that contributes to the Australian economy while also serving as an important marine habitat.", "B": "The Great Barrier Reef is the world\u2019s largest coral reef system, supporting over 1,500 species of fish and 400 types of coral, but it is increasingly threatened by climate change and pollution.", "C": "The Great Barrier Reef is a crucial ecological resource, home to thousands of species and playing a vital role in regulating the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.", "D": "Despite its economic importance, the Great Barrier Reef faces significant environmental challenges, including coral bleaching and destruction caused by overfishing and climate change.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly highlights the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecological significance, focusing on its biodiversity and role in regulating the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the reef\u2019s size and species, but does not address its critical ecological role as clearly as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it emphasizes the reef\u2019s tourism and economic impact, which is not the student\u2019s primary focus on its ecological significance. Choice D is incorrect because, while it mentions the environmental threats, it does not emphasize the reef\u2019s ecological importance in regulating the climate."}
