{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs have a lightweight build, long legs, and a flexible spine, which contribute to their ability to run at high speeds. Cheetahs primarily hunt small to medium-sized prey, such as gazelles, relying on speed rather than strength or stealth to catch them. Though cheetahs are incredibly fast, they are not as strong as other big cats like lions and tigers, and have difficulty taking down larger prey. Cheetahs are also vulnerable to threats from larger predators, such as lions, which can steal their kills or harm them.", "question": "The student wants to focus on how cheetahs use their bodies to achieve speed. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Cheetahs primarily hunt gazelles and other small animals, using speed as their primary method of capturing prey.", "B": "Unlike other big cats, cheetahs use their speed to catch small to medium-sized prey, relying on agility rather than strength to hunt.", "C": "Cheetahs have a lightweight build, long legs, and a flexible spine, which together enable them to run at incredible speeds over short distances.", "D": "Though cheetahs are the fastest land animals, they are vulnerable to larger predators like lions, which can threaten their survival.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly focuses on the cheetah\u2019s physical adaptations\u2014its lightweight build, long legs, and flexible spine\u2014that enable it to achieve speed. Choice B is incorrect because it emphasizes cheetahs' hunting strategy but does not directly address how their body contributes to their speed. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on their hunting habits and prey rather than the physical traits responsible for their speed. Choice D is incorrect because it highlights cheetah vulnerabilities but does not focus on their adaptations for speed."}
