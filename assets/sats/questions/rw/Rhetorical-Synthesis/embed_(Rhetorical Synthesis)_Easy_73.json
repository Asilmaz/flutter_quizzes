{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most well-preserved archaeological sites from the Inca civilization, dating back to the 15th century. The site is famous for its impressive stone structures, including terraces, temples, and a sophisticated water management system that illustrates the Inca's advanced engineering skills. Though its original purpose remains uncertain, many scholars believe Machu Picchu was a royal estate, while others suggest it had religious significance. Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911 by explorer Hiram Bingham, and since then, it has become a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world. The site continues to attract millions of visitors each year, who come to admire its beauty, history, and architectural grandeur.", "question": "The student wants to focus on Machu Picchu\u2019s architectural and engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Machu Picchu is an impressive example of Inca engineering, with its sophisticated water management system, terraces, and stone structures showcasing advanced architectural skills.", "B": "The Inca civilization\u2019s architectural achievements at Machu Picchu, such as its terraces and stone structures, make the site one of the most important archaeological discoveries of the 20th century.", "C": "Machu Picchu, known for its terraces and stone structures, is believed to have been a royal estate or religious center, reflecting the Inca\u2019s mastery of architecture and engineering.", "D": "Rediscovered in 1911, Machu Picchu is renowned for its advanced engineering, including water systems and terraces, which reflect the Inca\u2019s architectural expertise.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the architectural and engineering achievements of Machu Picchu, highlighting its sophisticated water management system, terraces, and stone structures. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the significance of the site\u2019s architectural features in an archaeological context, but it does not highlight specific engineering accomplishments. Choice C is incorrect because it speculates about the site\u2019s purpose but does not emphasize its architectural and engineering feats as effectively as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because while it mentions engineering accomplishments, it doesn\u2019t provide a clear focus on the specific achievements as much as  Choice A."}
