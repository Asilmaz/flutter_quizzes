{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, stands at 1,083 feet tall and was initially criticized by many Parisians for its unconventional design. Despite the criticism, the tower has become one of the most iconic landmarks in the world and is one of the most visited paid monuments, attracting millions of tourists annually. The tower was originally intended as a temporary structure but was later repurposed for use as a radio transmission tower. In addition to its engineering and architectural significance, the Eiffel Tower has been featured in countless works of art and literature and continues to symbolize Paris and French culture.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s impact on tourism. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Although initially unpopular, the Eiffel Tower became a symbol of Paris and has played an important role in tourism, bringing millions of visitors to the city each year.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower stands as a symbol of Paris and French culture, attracting millions of visitors who come to admire its iconic design.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, completed for the 1889 World's Fair, was initially meant to be temporary but has since become one of the world\u2019s most visited landmarks.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, initially criticized for its design, is now one of the most visited monuments in the world, drawing millions of tourists each year.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s status as one of the most visited monuments in the world, specifically noting its success in attracting millions of tourists annually, despite early criticism. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses more on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s symbolic importance rather than its direct impact on tourism. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the tower\u2019s temporary nature and the criticism it faced but does not fully highlight its tourism impact. Choice D is incorrect because, while it mentions the tower\u2019s role in tourism, it does not as directly focus on its high visitation numbers and influence as  Choice A."}
