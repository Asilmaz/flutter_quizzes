{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most famous and well-preserved archaeological sites from the Inca civilization. Built in the 15th century and abandoned in the 16th century, Machu Picchu remained hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery by Hiram Bingham in 1911. Machu Picchu is renowned for its impressive stonework, including temples, terraces, and an advanced water management system that showcases the Inca\u2019s engineering expertise. The purpose of Machu Picchu remains uncertain, but many scholars believe it may have been a royal estate or a religious center. The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors annually, who come to admire its beauty and learn about its historical significance.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Machu Picchu is an outstanding example of Incan engineering, featuring impressive stonework, advanced water management systems, and terraces that demonstrate the civilization's ingenuity.", "B": "Despite its debated purpose, Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering feats, including its terraces and advanced water systems, highlight the Inca\u2019s expertise in architecture and urban planning.", "C": "Machu Picchu, known for its unique stonework and water management system, is a testament to the Inca\u2019s engineering capabilities and is considered one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world.", "D": "The advanced water management system and terraces at Machu Picchu showcase the Inca\u2019s engineering abilities, making it a marvel of ancient design and construction.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice B is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the engineering achievements of Machu Picchu, focusing on its advanced water management system and terraces, which are key to showcasing the Inca's ingenuity. Choice A is incorrect because while it mentions engineering features, it does not focus on the specifics of the water management system and terraces as much as  Choice B. Choice C is incorrect because, while it mentions engineering and design, it places too much emphasis on the broader significance of Machu Picchu rather than directly focusing on its engineering achievements. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the site's purpose and cultural significance without highlighting the specific engineering accomplishments in enough detail as  Choice B does."}
