Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Pauline Hopkins was an influential African American writer whose serialized novel <em>Hagar\u2019s Daughter</em> is recognized as the first African American mystery novel.", "B": "Pauline Hopkins\u2019s works, such as <em>Hagar\u2019s Daughter</em>, explore themes of race and identity while also addressing issues of social justice and women\u2019s rights.", "C": "Hopkins\u2019s serialized novel <em>Hagar\u2019s Daughter</em> was the first African American mystery novel, and she was a prominent advocate for African American rights.", "D": "Pauline Hopkins, best known for <em>Hagar\u2019s Daughter</em>, was a journalist and writer who explored themes of race and empowerment in her works.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly introduces Pauline Hopkins, noting her influential role as a writer and emphasizing her most notable achievement, <em>Hagar\u2019s Daughter</em>, as the first African American mystery novel.
