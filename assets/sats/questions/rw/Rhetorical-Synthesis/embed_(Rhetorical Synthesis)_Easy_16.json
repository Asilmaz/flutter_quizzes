{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a man-made waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Isthmus of Panama. The canal has been a critical part of global trade, saving ships the long journey around the southern tip of South America. The construction of the Panama Canal was a monumental engineering project that required overcoming numerous challenges, including disease, challenging terrain, and financial difficulties. Since its opening, the Panama Canal has been expanded and modernized to accommodate larger ships and improve efficiency. In 1999, the United States handed control of the Panama Canal over to Panama, ending nearly a century of American ownership and operation.", "question": "The student wants to highlight the engineering challenges faced during the construction of the Panama Canal. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal was expanded and modernized after its opening to accommodate larger ships and improve efficiency.", "B": "The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and has been a key element of global trade since its completion in 1914.", "C": "In 1999, the United States handed control of the Panama Canal to Panama, ending nearly a century of American ownership and operation.", "D": "The construction of the Panama Canal was a monumental engineering project, requiring the overcoming of challenges such as disease, difficult terrain, and financial issues.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly addresses the engineering challenges involved in constructing the Panama Canal, such as disease, difficult terrain, and financial difficulties. Choice B is incorrect because it discusses the canal\u2019s role in trade but does not emphasize the engineering challenges faced during construction. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the transfer of control of the canal, which is unrelated to the engineering difficulties. Choice D is incorrect because it talks about later expansions, not the initial construction challenges."}
