{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts, making them highly effective hunters. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs rely on their speed rather than strength or stealth, using it to chase down prey such as gazelles and antelopes in open terrain. Cheetahs\u2019 unique physical adaptations, including a lightweight body, long legs, and a flexible spine, allow them to achieve incredible acceleration and maintain high speeds for short distances. However, their reliance on speed makes them vulnerable to larger predators, such as lions and hyenas, which often steal their kills or pose threats to their cubs. Cheetahs also face significant threats from habitat loss and declining prey populations, both of which are contributing to their decreasing numbers in the wild.", "question": "The student wants to focus on how cheetahs use their physical adaptations for hunting. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, which allows them to hunt small to medium-sized prey in open landscapes.", "B": "Cheetahs, with their lightweight bodies, long legs, and flexible spines, use their physical adaptations to achieve incredible speed, which helps them chase down prey like gazelles in open terrain.", "C": "Despite their speed, cheetahs are vulnerable to larger predators like lions and hyenas, which can steal their kills or threaten their survival.", "D": "The unique adaptations of cheetahs, including long legs and a lightweight build, make them the fastest land animals, but their speed is only effective over short distances.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it specifically emphasizes how cheetahs\u2019 physical adaptations enable them to achieve high speeds, which are crucial for hunting prey in open terrain. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the cheetah\u2019s speed and prey size but does not explain how their physical adaptations allow them to achieve that speed. Choice C is incorrect because it highlights the threats cheetahs face from predators rather than their hunting abilities or physical adaptations. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses their speed but doesn\u2019t link it clearly to the hunting process or highlight the role of their physical adaptations."}
