{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was completed in 1889 as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. Initially, many Parisians criticized the tower\u2019s design, but it has since become a beloved symbol of Paris and one of the most recognized structures in the world. The tower is made of wrought iron, which gives it a unique appearance and allows it to withstand high winds. It attracts over 7 million visitors annually, making it one of the most visited monuments in the world.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Eiffel Tower's design. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, made of wrought iron, was designed to withstand high winds and is known for its unique appearance.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower was criticized by many when it was first constructed but has since become an iconic symbol of Paris, attracting millions of visitors.", "C": "Standing at 1,083 feet tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the 1930s.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 as the entrance arch for the World's Fair and continues to be a major tourist attraction.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it emphasizes the Eiffel Tower's design, specifically its use of wrought iron and its ability to withstand high winds, while also noting its unique appearance. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on public reaction to the tower rather than its design features. Choice C is incorrect because it highlights the tower\u2019s height and status, which does not focus on its design. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the tower\u2019s purpose and tourism rather than the specifics of its design."}
