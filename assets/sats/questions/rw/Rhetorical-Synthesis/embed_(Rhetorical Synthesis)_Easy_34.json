{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, an ancient Inca city located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, was built in the 15th century and abandoned in the 16th century. The site is famous for its well-preserved ruins, including terracing, temples, and an extensive network of stairs. The purpose of Machu Picchu is still debated, with theories suggesting it was either a royal estate or a religious center. The city was rediscovered in 1911 by explorer Hiram Bingham and has since become a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist destination. Machu Picchu\u2019s remote location and dramatic setting high in the mountains make it one of the most iconic archaeological sites in the world.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the significance of Machu Picchu\u2019s location. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Machu Picchu was built in the 15th century by the Incas and later abandoned, but its rediscovery in 1911 made it a major archaeological site.", "B": "Machu Picchu\u2019s dramatic location high in the Andes Mountains, combined with its well-preserved ruins, makes it one of the most iconic archaeological sites in the world.", "C": "Machu Picchu is famous for its terracing and temples, which suggest it may have been used as a royal estate or a religious center.", "D": "Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911 and has since become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors each year.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it emphasizes Machu Picchu\u2019s significance through its dramatic location in the Andes Mountains, along with its well-preserved ruins and iconic status. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the timeline of Machu Picchu\u2019s construction and rediscovery, but does not emphasize the importance of its location. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the possible uses of the site rather than its location. Choice D is incorrect because it highlights the rediscovery and UNESCO designation but does not mention the dramatic setting or location."}
