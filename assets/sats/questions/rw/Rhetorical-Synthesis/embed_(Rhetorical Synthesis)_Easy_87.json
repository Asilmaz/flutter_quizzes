{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile-long waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, drastically reducing the travel distance for ships. This engineering marvel has played a significant role in global trade, enabling ships to bypass the long and treacherous route around South America. The canal was initially controlled by the United States, but in 1999, it was transferred to Panama under the Panama Canal Treaty, granting Panama sovereignty over the canal. In addition to its economic importance, the canal has strategic significance, providing a vital shortcut for international shipping routes and facilitating the movement of goods across the world. Over the years, the canal has been expanded, with the <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em> project completed in 2016, allowing for the passage of larger vessels.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Panama Canal\u2019s impact on global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal has played a major role in global commerce, and its expansion in 2016 allowed for the passage of larger ships, further increasing its importance in international shipping.", "B": "The Panama Canal, built in 1914, serves as a critical waterway for international trade, shortening shipping routes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "C": "The Panama Canal has significantly boosted global trade by providing a shortcut for international shipping routes, reducing travel time and facilitating the movement of goods across the world.", "D": "Despite its strategic and economic significance, the Panama Canal faces challenges such as political tensions and environmental concerns that threaten its long-term viability.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly highlights the Panama Canal\u2019s impact on global trade, focusing on how it facilitates international shipping routes by reducing travel time and allowing the movement of goods. Choice B is incorrect because, although it discusses the canal\u2019s importance, it doesn\u2019t emphasize its direct impact on global trade and efficiency as effectively as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses too much on the expansion and doesn\u2019t highlight the broader role the canal plays in global trade as much as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because, while it mentions challenges, it focuses on potential problems rather than emphasizing the canal\u2019s clear contribution to global trade."}
