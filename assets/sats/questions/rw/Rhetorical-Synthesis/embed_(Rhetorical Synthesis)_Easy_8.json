{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The cheetah is the fastest land animal, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs have a lightweight build and specialized body features, including a flexible spine, long legs, and large nasal passages to aid in oxygen intake during high-speed chases. Cheetahs primarily hunt small to medium-sized prey, such as gazelles, and rely on their speed rather than strength or stealth to catch them. They are found in sub-Saharan Africa, though their numbers are declining due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict. Cheetahs are also unique among big cats because they cannot roar; instead, they communicate with purrs, chirps, and hisses.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize how the cheetah uses its body for speed. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts, thanks to their lightweight build.", "B": "Unlike other big cats, cheetahs rely on their speed rather than strength or stealth to catch prey, such as gazelles.", "C": "Cheetahs have a lightweight build and specialized body features, such as a flexible spine and long legs, which help them achieve their incredible speed.", "D": "Cheetahs communicate with purrs, chirps, and hisses, which is unique among big cats that are generally known for their roars.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes how the cheetah\u2019s body is designed for speed, mentioning key features like the flexible spine and long legs. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the cheetah\u2019s hunting strategy (speed vs. strength) rather than its body\u2019s adaptation for speed. Choice C is incorrect because it mentions the cheetah\u2019s speed but doesn't provide enough detail about how its body supports this speed. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses communication, which is unrelated to the cheetah\u2019s physical adaptations for speed."}
