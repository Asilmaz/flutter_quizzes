{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most famous and well-preserved archaeological sites from the Inca civilization. The site was built in the 15th century and abandoned in the 16th century. It remained hidden from the outside world until 1911 when American explorer Hiram Bingham rediscovered it. Machu Picchu is renowned for its impressive stonework, including the construction of temples, terraces, and an advanced water management system that showcases the Inca\u2019s architectural expertise. Although the exact purpose of Machu Picchu remains unclear, many scholars believe it may have been a royal estate or a religious center. Today, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors each year who come to admire its historical significance and engineering marvels.", "question": "The student wants to focus on Machu Picchu\u2019s architectural and engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Machu Picchu\u2019s impressive stonework and advanced water management system showcase the Inca\u2019s architectural and engineering expertise, making it one of the greatest achievements of ancient civilizations.", "B": "The advanced water management system and terraces at Machu Picchu highlight the Inca\u2019s engineering abilities, reflecting their mastery in architecture and innovative construction techniques.", "C": "Despite its uncertain purpose, Machu Picchu is a marvel of Inca engineering, with its impressive stonework and water management system demonstrating the sophistication of the Inca civilization.", "D": "Machu Picchu, renowned for its advanced stonework and water management system, is a testament to the Inca\u2019s architectural genius, making it one of the most remarkable archaeological sites in the world.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice D is the best answer because it emphasizes both the stonework and water management system, while clearly presenting these features as a testament to the Inca's architectural genius. It aligns with the student's goal of focusing on the architectural and engineering achievements of Machu Picchu. Choice A is incorrect because it mentions the architectural achievements but lacks emphasis on specific features like the terraces and water management system, which are key to the engineering aspect. Choice B is incorrect because while it mentions the water management system and terraces, it does not fully capture the broader significance of Machu Picchu\u2019s architectural innovations as  Choice D does. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses too much on the uncertainty of the site\u2019s purpose and doesn\u2019t highlight the specific engineering feats as strongly as  Choice D."}
