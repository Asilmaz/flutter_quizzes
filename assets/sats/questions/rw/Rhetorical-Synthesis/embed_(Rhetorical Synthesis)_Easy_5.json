{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world, flowing for about 4,345 miles across South America. It drains an area of approximately 2.7 million square miles, making it the largest river basin in the world. The Amazon is known for its rich biodiversity, with an estimated 10% of the world\u2019s species found within its basin. The river supports a variety of ecosystems, from dense rainforests to flooded wetlands, and is home to species such as the Amazon river dolphin and the piranha. The Amazon River has been an important cultural and economic resource for indigenous peoples for centuries.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the length of the Amazon River. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Amazon River basin is home to approximately 10% of the world\u2019s species, with diverse ecosystems ranging from rainforests to wetlands.", "B": "The Amazon River, which flows for about 4,345 miles, is the second longest river in the world.", "C": "The Amazon River supports many ecosystems and is home to species such as the river dolphin and piranha.", "D": "Flowing across South America, the Amazon River has been a vital resource for indigenous peoples for centuries.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the length of the Amazon River, noting its 4,345 miles of flow. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on biodiversity and ecosystems, not the river\u2019s length. Choice C is incorrect because it emphasizes the river\u2019s ecosystems and species rather than its length. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the river\u2019s cultural significance but does not mention its length."}
