	"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:",
	"text": "• A group of mathematicians known as Nicolas Bourbaki was formed in 1935.\n• They were actually pseudonymous; “Bourbaki” was not a single individual but a collective of young French mathematicians.\n• Their goal was to reformulate mathematics on an extremely rigorous, foundational basis.\n• They published a long series of influential textbooks covering topics from set theory to advanced calculus.\n• Their works influenced the structure of math curricula worldwide.",
	"question": "The student wants to stress the unusual nature of Nicolas Bourbaki’s authorship. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
	"A": "Bourbaki’s textbooks, spanning from set theory to advanced calculus, influenced math curricula worldwide.",
	"B": "Formed in 1935, the collective known as Nicolas Bourbaki published many foundational works on mathematics.",
	"C": "The name Nicolas Bourbaki was used by a group of young French mathematicians who wrote rigorous texts under a single pseudonym.",
	"D": "Mathematicians from France shaped the field with new definitions and approaches to foundational math.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C highlights the pseudonymous and collective nature of Bourbaki, fulfilling the goal of emphasizing the group’s unusual authorship."
