{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has provided breathtaking images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and planets. One of the most famous images taken by the Hubble Telescope is the Pillars of Creation, which shows giant columns of gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula. The telescope has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, helping scientists learn more about the age of the universe and the expansion of space. The Hubble Space Telescope is often considered one of the most important astronomical tools ever built, contributing to significant discoveries in astrophysics. It has undergone several upgrades and repairs to keep it functional and improve its capabilities over the years.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the contributions of the Hubble Space Telescope. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Hubble Space Telescope has made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of the universe, including discoveries about its age and expansion.", "B": "Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has provided stunning images of distant galaxies, including the famous Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula.", "C": "The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most important astronomical tools ever built, helping to revolutionize our understanding of the universe.", "D": "Over the years, the Hubble Space Telescope has undergone upgrades and repairs to improve its capabilities and functionality.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice D is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Hubble Space Telescope's overall contributions to science, noting its importance in revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on specific discoveries but does not emphasize the telescope\u2019s broad impact. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on a specific image and doesn\u2019t highlight the telescope\u2019s overall contributions. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the telescope\u2019s repairs and upgrades, which do not emphasize its contributions to understanding the universe."}
