{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, France. It was designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel and stands 1,083 feet tall. The tower was initially criticized by many for its unconventional design, but it has since become a symbol of Paris and France. Over 7 million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year, making it one of the most visited paid monuments in the world. The Eiffel Tower was initially constructed as a temporary structure for the World\u2019s Fair but became a permanent landmark due to its popularity.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s popularity. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Constructed for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, the Eiffel Tower has become an iconic landmark in the city.", "B": "Designed by Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower stands 1,083 feet tall and was completed in 1889.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower was initially criticized for its design, but it has since become a beloved symbol of Paris and France.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, initially intended as a temporary structure, is now one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, attracting over 7 million visitors annually.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer. It directly emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s popularity, mentioning its status as one of the most visited paid monuments in the world and the number of visitors it attracts annually. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the tower\u2019s design and height rather than its popularity. Choice C is incorrect because it mentions the criticism of the tower\u2019s design, but it does not focus on its current popularity. Choice D is incorrect because while it highlights the tower\u2019s iconic status, it doesn\u2019t mention its popularity or visitor numbers."}
