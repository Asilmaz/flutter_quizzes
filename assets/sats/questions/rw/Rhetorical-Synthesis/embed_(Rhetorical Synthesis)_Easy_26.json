{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 for the 1889 World\u2019s Fair, is one of the most iconic landmarks in Paris. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. Made of wrought iron, the Eiffel Tower\u2019s design was initially controversial, with many Parisians criticizing its unconventional style. Today, it is one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year. The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and has been expanded with additional features, including a glass floor at the top and a restaurant.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s design. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, designed by Gustave Eiffel, is made of wrought iron and was initially criticized for its unconventional design but is now beloved as an iconic symbol of Paris.", "B": "Standing at 1,083 feet tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in 1930.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, is one of the most visited landmarks in the world, attracting millions of tourists every year.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower has undergone expansions, including a glass floor at the top and a restaurant, making it even more popular among visitors.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s design, mentioning both the material (wrought iron) and the initial criticism it received, which is central to its design history. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the height and historical significance but does not address the design or appearance. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s popularity and tourism, not its design. Choice D is incorrect because it mentions features added later, like the glass floor and restaurant, but does not emphasize the original design and its significance."}
