{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is one of the most iconic and impressive structures in the world, originally built to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes. Construction began as early as the 7th century BCE, with different sections of the wall constructed by various Chinese dynasties, including the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. The Great Wall is made from a variety of materials, including earth, wood, and brick, with the design adapting to the different terrains it passed through, such as deserts and mountains. Though its original military function was to protect China\u2019s borders, the wall has also served as a symbol of China\u2019s strength and resilience over time. Today, the Great Wall is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, drawing millions of visitors annually who come to admire its historical significance and architectural beauty.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Great Wall\u2019s military purpose. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China was built primarily to protect China from invasions, serving as a military defense system that adapted to different terrains along its path.", "B": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is an iconic symbol of Chinese strength and resilience, originally constructed to protect against northern invasions.", "C": "The Great Wall of China, made from various materials and built by multiple dynasties, is not only a symbol of China\u2019s power but also served as a defense against invasions by nomadic tribes.", "D": "The Great Wall of China, originally constructed to defend China from invaders, has become one of the most famous landmarks in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it focuses directly on the Great Wall\u2019s primary military purpose: to protect China from invasions, and it highlights how the wall adapted to different terrains, which is crucial to its function as a military defense system. Choice B is incorrect because it emphasizes the symbolic aspects of the wall without focusing enough on its original military purpose. Choice C is incorrect because while it mentions the wall\u2019s role in defense, it focuses too much on its symbolic nature and doesn\u2019t emphasize the military purpose as clearly as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the wall\u2019s status as a tourist attraction rather than on its military significance."}
