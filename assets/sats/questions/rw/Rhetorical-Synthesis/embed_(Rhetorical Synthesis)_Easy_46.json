{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Colosseum, located in Rome, Italy, is one of the largest and most iconic amphitheaters ever built in the ancient world. Completed in 80 CE, the Colosseum could hold up to 50,000 spectators, who came to watch gladiatorial games, animal hunts, and mock naval battles. The Colosseum was an engineering marvel of its time, featuring a complex system of passageways, elevators, and trapdoors that allowed for quick movement of gladiators and animals during events. Despite being severely damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuries, the Colosseum remains an enduring symbol of ancient Roman architecture. Today, it is a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors each year who come to explore its ruins and learn about its history.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Colosseum\u2019s engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Built to accommodate large crowds for events like gladiatorial games and mock battles, the Colosseum is a testament to the grandeur of ancient Rome.", "B": "The Colosseum, originally capable of holding 50,000 spectators, became a symbol of Roman architecture and remains a major tourist attraction today.", "C": "Despite its damage over the centuries, the Colosseum continues to serve as an iconic landmark and popular destination for tourists visiting Rome.", "D": "The Colosseum\u2019s design included a complex system of passageways, elevators, and trapdoors, demonstrating the advanced engineering skills of the ancient Romans.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Colosseum\u2019s engineering achievements, focusing on its design features such as passageways, elevators, and trapdoors. Choice B is incorrect because it mentions the Colosseum's capacity and symbolic status but does not highlight its engineering marvels. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the Colosseum\u2019s current role as a tourist attraction, rather than its engineering innovations. Choice D is incorrect because, although it mentions the Colosseum's function, it does not delve into its engineering accomplishments."}
