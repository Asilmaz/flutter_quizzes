{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile-long waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, cutting the travel distance for ships by thousands of miles. The canal has played a critical role in global trade, allowing ships to bypass the lengthy and dangerous route around South America. The United States initially controlled the canal, but in 1999, the Panama Canal Treaty transferred control to Panama, giving the country greater control over this vital waterway. Over the years, the canal has been expanded to accommodate larger ships, with the <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em> project completed in 2016. Despite its importance in trade, the canal faces ongoing environmental and political challenges that threaten its long-term viability.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Panama Canal\u2019s role in global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Despite facing political and environmental challenges, the Panama Canal remains a critical waterway for global trade, saving ships from the long journey around South America.", "B": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, played a critical role in global trade by shortening shipping routes and has been expanded in recent years to accommodate larger vessels.", "C": "The Panama Canal, initially controlled by the United States and later handed over to Panama, has long been a key player in global shipping, facilitating faster and more efficient trade.", "D": "The Panama Canal has significantly impacted global trade by providing a shorter, more efficient route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, saving ships thousands of miles.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly focuses on the Panama Canal\u2019s key impact on global trade, emphasizing its role in shortening shipping routes and improving trade efficiency. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the canal\u2019s impact on trade and its expansion, it does not emphasize its primary function in shortening travel distances as clearly as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the canal\u2019s control history and political aspects, which are less relevant to the student\u2019s focus on global trade. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses challenges faced by the canal without emphasizing its core role in global trade as clearly as  Choice A."}
