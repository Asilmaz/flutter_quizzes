{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon River is the second-longest river in the world, flowing for about 4,345 miles across South America. It drains an area of approximately 2.7 million square miles, making it the largest river basin in the world. The Amazon River is known for its rich biodiversity, housing 10% of the world\u2019s known species, including a variety of fish, birds, and mammals. In addition to its ecological importance, the river plays a critical role in regulating the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Deforestation in the Amazon poses a serious threat to its ecosystem, as it leads to the loss of biodiversity and contributes to climate change.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Amazon River\u2019s role in regulating the global climate. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "In addition to its biodiversity, the Amazon River plays a critical role in the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, which helps stabilize the atmosphere.", "B": "The Amazon River, the largest river basin in the world, is home to 10% of the world\u2019s species, making it one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.", "C": "The Amazon River is crucial for regulating the global climate, as it absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, helping to stabilize the Earth's atmosphere.", "D": "The Amazon River, flowing through 2.7 million square miles, is known for its rich biodiversity and its vital role in supporting global ecosystems and climate regulation.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice C is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Amazon River\u2019s role in regulating the global climate, specifically mentioning its absorption of carbon dioxide and production of oxygen. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the river\u2019s climate regulation but does not address the broader ecological importance of the Amazon as effectively as  Choice C. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses only on the Amazon\u2019s biodiversity, which is important but not the focus of the student\u2019s task. Choice D is incorrect because it describes the Amazon\u2019s size and biodiversity but doesn\u2019t emphasize its role in climate regulation as clearly as  Choice C."}
