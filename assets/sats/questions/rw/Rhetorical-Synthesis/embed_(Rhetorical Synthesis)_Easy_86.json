{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, an ancient Incan city located high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. The city was built in the 15th century and abandoned in the 16th century, likely due to the arrival of Spanish conquistadors. It remained hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery in 1911 by explorer Hiram Bingham. Machu Picchu is known for its impressive stone architecture, including temples, terraces, and an advanced system of water management that demonstrates the Inca\u2019s engineering expertise. Despite its mystery, scholars believe that Machu Picchu was either a royal estate or a religious center, though its true purpose remains debated. The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of tourists each year, drawn by its historical significance and breathtaking views.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize Machu Picchu\u2019s architectural and engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Machu Picchu is renowned for its impressive stone architecture, including temples, terraces, and a sophisticated water management system that highlights the Inca\u2019s advanced engineering skills.", "B": "Machu Picchu, built in the 15th century and abandoned by the 16th century, is an ancient Incan city that attracts millions of tourists each year due to its beauty and mystery.", "C": "The rediscovery of Machu Picchu in 1911 brought global attention to the site, where many believe it served as a royal estate or religious center.", "D": "The Inca\u2019s advanced engineering techniques are evident in Machu Picchu\u2019s water management systems and terracing, which continue to be studied by scholars today.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes Machu Picchu\u2019s architectural and engineering achievements, particularly the impressive stone structures and advanced water management system, which showcase the Inca\u2019s engineering skills. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions Machu Picchu\u2019s appeal and tourism, it doesn\u2019t focus on the architectural and engineering aspects of the site as clearly as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the site's purpose and historical discovery, not its architectural and engineering features. Choice D is incorrect because it talks about the engineering aspects but does not provide as comprehensive a focus on the specific features, such as the stone architecture, that make Machu Picchu so significant."}
