{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, a 51-mile waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, was completed in 1914. The canal has had a profound impact on global trade by significantly reducing the travel distance for ships, eliminating the need to navigate around South America. In 1999, the United States handed over control of the canal to Panama as part of the Panama Canal Treaty, a decision that increased Panama's control over its own territory. The canal has been expanded over the years to accommodate larger ships, with the <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em> project completed in 2016. Despite its importance in facilitating global trade, the canal has faced challenges due to political tensions and the environmental impact of its construction and expansion.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Panama Canal\u2019s role in global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal, initially controlled by the United States and later handed over to Panama in 1999, continues to play a major role in facilitating global trade.", "B": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914 and expanded in 2016, has facilitated international trade by providing a shorter and more efficient route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "C": "The Panama Canal\u2019s expansion in 2016 allowed for larger ships to pass through, increasing its importance in global shipping and international trade.", "D": "The Panama Canal has had a significant impact on global trade by shortening shipping routes, making international trade more efficient and cost-effective.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly highlights the Panama Canal\u2019s role in global trade, focusing on its ability to shorten shipping routes and make trade more efficient. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the canal\u2019s importance, it focuses more on the completion and expansion rather than its overall role in trade. Choice C is incorrect because it mentions the expansion but does not fully emphasize the primary role of the canal in facilitating global trade. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the canal's control and political aspects, which are less relevant to the student\u2019s task of emphasizing its role in global trade."}
