{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most famous and well-preserved archaeological sites in the world. It was built in the 15th century by the Inca Empire and abandoned in the 16th century, possibly due to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. The site is famous for its impressive stonework, including terraces, temples, and an intricate network of stairs that connect different levels of the city. Machu Picchu remained hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery in 1911 by explorer Hiram Bingham, which brought international attention to the site. In addition to its historical and architectural significance, Machu Picchu is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of tourists each year.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize Machu Picchu\u2019s historical and architectural significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The site of Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains, remained hidden for centuries and showcases the advanced architecture of the Inca civilization, making it one of the most important archaeological sites in the world.", "B": "Rediscovered in 1911, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of tourists each year to explore its remarkable ruins and learn about Inca history.", "C": "Machu Picchu, built in the 15th century by the Inca Empire, is an architectural marvel famous for its terraces, temples, and intricate stonework that highlight the engineering skills of the Inca.", "D": "Built in the 15th century, Machu Picchu\u2019s terraces and temples represent the engineering achievements of the Inca Empire, though its true purpose remains a subject of debate.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly focuses on the historical and architectural significance of Machu Picchu, emphasizing its construction by the Inca Empire and the impressive architectural features that showcase the civilization\u2019s engineering skills. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses too much on the modern status of Machu Picchu as a tourist destination rather than its original architectural and historical significance. Choice C is incorrect because while it mentions Machu Picchu\u2019s location and its architectural significance, it does not focus on its design and engineering accomplishments as directly as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because while it mentions the purpose and features of Machu Picchu, it doesn't emphasize its architectural significance in the same way as  Choice A."}
