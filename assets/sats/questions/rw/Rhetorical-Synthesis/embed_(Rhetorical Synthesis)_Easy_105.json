{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is one of the most iconic structures in the world, originally built to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes. Construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BCE, and different sections were built by various Chinese dynasties, including the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. The Great Wall\u2019s design adapted to the various terrains it passed through, from deserts to mountains, and was made from a variety of materials, such as earth, wood, and brick. Though its original purpose was military, the Great Wall also became a symbol of Chinese strength and perseverance, representing the determination of the Chinese people to defend their land. Today, the Great Wall is one of the most visited landmarks in the world, attracting millions of visitors who come to admire its scale, history, and cultural significance.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Great Wall\u2019s military purpose. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, served as a military defense system, designed to protect China from invasions and symbolize the strength of the Chinese people.", "B": "The Great Wall of China was built to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes, serving as a military defense system that adapted to the diverse terrains it crossed.", "C": "Built by various Chinese dynasties, the Great Wall of China served as a key military defense system, adapting to different terrains and offering protection against invasions.", "D": "The Great Wall of China, despite its symbolic significance, was originally constructed to defend China from invasions, reflecting the engineering ingenuity of ancient Chinese builders.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly focuses on the Great Wall\u2019s military purpose, highlighting its role as a defense system against invasions and its adaptation to different terrains, which was critical to its effectiveness. Choice B is incorrect because while it mentions both defense and symbolism, it focuses more on the symbolic aspects of the wall rather than its direct military function. Choice C is incorrect because, although it emphasizes the wall\u2019s military purpose, it does not focus enough on its specific design features, such as adaptation to terrain, that made it an effective defense system. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the symbolic importance and engineering without emphasizing the military purpose as clearly as  Choice A."}
