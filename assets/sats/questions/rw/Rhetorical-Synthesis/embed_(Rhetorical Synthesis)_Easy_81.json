{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon Rainforest, located in South America, is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering approximately 2.7 million square miles. The rainforest is home to a vast array of species, including jaguars, sloths, and macaws, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. In addition to its biodiversity, the Amazon plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. The rainforest is often called the \u201clungs of the planet\u201d because it produces 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen, making it essential for life on Earth. The Amazon is under significant threat from deforestation and climate change, which are rapidly diminishing its size and capacity to support biodiversity and regulate the climate.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Amazon Rainforest\u2019s role in climate regulation. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Despite being under threat from deforestation and climate change, the Amazon Rainforest remains a vital source of oxygen and biodiversity for the planet.", "B": "The Amazon Rainforest, covering 2.7 million square miles, is home to a wide variety of species, including jaguars, macaws, and sloths, many of which are unique to the region.", "C": "Known as the \u201clungs of the planet,\u201d the Amazon Rainforest produces oxygen and supports countless species, making it a vital ecosystem for the Earth.", "D": "The Amazon Rainforest plays a critical role in regulating the global climate, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen, which is vital for life on Earth.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it emphasizes the Amazon Rainforest\u2019s essential role in climate regulation, focusing on its ability to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, which are critical for life on Earth. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions biodiversity, it does not focus on the rainforest\u2019s role in regulating the climate. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the rainforest\u2019s nickname and general importance without emphasizing its specific climate-regulating function. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on threats to the rainforest and its broader importance rather than its role in climate regulation."}
