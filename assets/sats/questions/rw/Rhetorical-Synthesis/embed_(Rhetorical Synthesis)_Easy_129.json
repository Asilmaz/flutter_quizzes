{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most well-preserved archaeological sites from the Inca civilization. It is believed to have been constructed in the 15th century and abandoned shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The site includes impressive stonework, such as temples, terraces, and an advanced water management system that demonstrates the Inca\u2019s remarkable engineering skills. Though the exact purpose of Machu Picchu remains unclear, many scholars believe it was either a royal estate or a religious center, highlighting its importance in Inca society. Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911 by American explorer Hiram Bingham, and it has since become one of the most iconic archaeological sites in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year.", "question": "The student wants to focus on Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The advanced water management system and sophisticated stonework at Machu Picchu highlight the Inca\u2019s engineering brilliance, making the site one of the most impressive achievements of ancient architecture.", "B": "Machu Picchu\u2019s impressive stonework and terraces demonstrate the Inca\u2019s architectural expertise, with its advanced water management system showcasing their engineering ingenuity.", "C": "Despite the uncertainties surrounding its purpose, Machu Picchu remains a symbol of Inca engineering and architectural achievement, with its sophisticated water management system and intricate stonework.", "D": "The water management system and terraces at Machu Picchu showcase the Inca\u2019s remarkable ability to design and build in challenging environments, reflecting their architectural and engineering skills.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice C is the best answer because it emphasizes both the engineering and architectural aspects of Machu Picchu, specifically mentioning the water management system and terraces as a reflection of the Inca\u2019s design and building capabilities. This directly addresses the student's focus on engineering. Choice A is incorrect because, while it mentions the water management system and stonework, it doesn\u2019t fully integrate the notion of designing for challenging environments, which is central to the engineering challenge of building Machu Picchu. Choice B is incorrect because, although it mentions the key features like the stonework and water system, it does not emphasize the environmental adaptation of the design as much as  Choice C. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses too much on the symbolism of Machu Picchu and does not highlight the practical aspects of its engineering achievements as clearly as  Choice C."}
