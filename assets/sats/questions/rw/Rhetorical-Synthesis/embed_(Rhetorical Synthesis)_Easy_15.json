{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Mount Everest, located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and China, is the tallest mountain in the world, standing at 29,032 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. The mountain is part of the greater Himalayan range, which stretches across five countries in Asia, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan. Mount Everest has long been a subject of fascination for climbers, and it attracts thousands of mountaineers each year, despite the challenges posed by its extreme height, dangerous weather conditions, and the risk of avalanches. Climbing Mount Everest is a formidable challenge, with only a small percentage of climbers successfully reaching the summit. The first successful summit of Mount Everest was achieved in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the mountain's status as the tallest in the world. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Mount Everest attracts thousands of climbers each year, despite its dangerous weather conditions and the risk of avalanches.", "B": "Mount Everest is part of the Himalayan range, which stretches across five countries in Asia, including Nepal, China, and India.", "C": "The first successful summit of Mount Everest was achieved in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, marking a historic achievement in mountaineering.", "D": "Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, standing at 29,032 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level, and is located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and China.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it clearly emphasizes the fact that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, providing the specific height and location. Choice B is incorrect because it discusses the location of Mount Everest but does not directly emphasize its status as the tallest mountain. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the historical summit, which does not emphasize Everest's height. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the challenges faced by climbers, which does not directly relate to Mount Everest's height."}
