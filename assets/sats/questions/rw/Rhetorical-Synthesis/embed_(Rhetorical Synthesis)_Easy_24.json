{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, a 51-mile waterway that cuts through the Isthmus of Panama, connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It was completed in 1914, after more than a decade of construction, and is considered one of the greatest engineering feats of the 20th century. The canal was initially controlled by the United States, but in 1999, control was handed over to Panama as part of the Panama Canal Treaty. The canal is crucial for global trade, as it saves ships the long and dangerous journey around the southern tip of South America. The Panama Canal has been expanded over the years to accommodate larger vessels, including the introduction of the <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em> project, completed in 2016.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the importance of the Panama Canal for global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal plays a critical role in global trade, providing a shortcut that saves ships the long journey around South America and accommodates larger vessels through its expansion.", "B": "Completed in 1914, the Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, making it an essential route for international shipping.", "C": "The Panama Canal, initially controlled by the United States, was handed over to Panama in 1999 and has since undergone significant expansions.", "D": "The Panama Canal\u2019s construction was a monumental engineering feat, completed after over a decade of work and contributing to the global shipping industry.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Panama Canal\u2019s importance for global trade, mentioning its role as a shortcut and its expansion to accommodate larger vessels. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the canal\u2019s completion and function but doesn\u2019t emphasize its significance for global trade. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the transfer of control and expansion, but it does not emphasize the canal\u2019s vital role in trade. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the engineering feat of the canal\u2019s construction rather than its ongoing importance for trade."}
