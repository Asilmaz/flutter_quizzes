{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile-long waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, drastically reducing the travel distance for ships. It is one of the most important engineering feats of the 20th century, providing a shortcut for international shipping and facilitating global trade by allowing ships to avoid the long and dangerous route around South America. The canal was initially controlled by the United States, but in 1999, control was transferred to Panama under the Panama Canal Treaty, granting Panama sovereignty over the waterway. In 2016, the Panama Canal underwent a major expansion to accommodate larger vessels, further increasing its importance to global commerce. The canal continues to play a central role in international trade, allowing the efficient movement of goods between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, benefiting the global economy.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Panama Canal\u2019s contribution to global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal, initially under U.S. control and later transferred to Panama, remains a vital waterway for international shipping, contributing to global economic growth by improving trade efficiency.", "B": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914 and expanded in 2016, continues to play a crucial role in international trade by providing a faster route for goods to travel between the two oceans.", "C": "The Panama Canal has greatly facilitated global trade by providing a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, reducing shipping times and increasing the efficiency of international commerce.", "D": "The Panama Canal, stretching over 51 miles, has been essential for global trade by allowing ships to avoid the long journey around South America, facilitating the movement of goods between continents.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it clearly highlights the Panama Canal\u2019s contribution to global trade by emphasizing its role in reducing shipping times and improving efficiency. These are the key aspects of the student\u2019s focus. Choice B is incorrect because it mentions the canal\u2019s expansion but does not emphasize its direct contribution to trade efficiency as much as  Choice A does. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses more on the political control of the canal and its global economic impact without directly addressing how it facilitates trade. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the canal\u2019s route and its contribution to the movement of goods but does not directly address the efficiency and economic benefits of the shortcut, as  Choice A does."}
