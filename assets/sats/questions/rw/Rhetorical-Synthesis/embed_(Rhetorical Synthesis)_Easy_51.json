{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, completed in 1644, is one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history. Stretching over 13,000 miles, the wall was originally built to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north. Made from a variety of materials such as earth, wood, and brick, the Great Wall\u2019s design changed depending on the terrain it passed through. While the wall served its military purpose for many years, its significance has evolved, and it is now considered a symbol of China\u2019s strength and determination. Today, the Great Wall is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, drawing millions of visitors annually.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Great Wall\u2019s military function. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China was built primarily to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes, serving as a military defense system for many years.", "B": "Stretching over 13,000 miles, the Great Wall of China was built to protect China\u2019s northern borders and is now one of the most iconic symbols of Chinese strength.", "C": "The Great Wall\u2019s design changed depending on the terrain it passed through, with materials like earth, wood, and brick used to construct different sections of the wall.", "D": "The Great Wall of China served as a defensive structure for centuries but is now a major tourist attraction that symbolizes China\u2019s history and culture.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it clearly emphasizes the Great Wall\u2019s original military purpose\u2014to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes. Choice B is incorrect because while it mentions the protective role of the Great Wall, it focuses too much on its current symbolic meaning and tourism. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the design and construction of the wall but does not highlight its military function. Choice D is incorrect because, while it acknowledges the wall\u2019s military purpose, it focuses more on its current status as a tourist attraction rather than its original function."}
