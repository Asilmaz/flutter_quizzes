{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, spanning nine countries in South America. It covers approximately 2.7 million square miles, making it crucial for regulating the Earth's climate. The Amazon is home to about 10% of the known species on Earth, including a wide variety of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern due to its impact on biodiversity and the global climate. In addition to its ecological significance, the Amazon Rainforest is culturally important, home to many indigenous tribes.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Amazon Rainforest\u2019s biodiversity. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Amazon Rainforest is culturally important and is home to many indigenous tribes who rely on its resources.", "B": "The Amazon Rainforest spans nine countries in South America, covering approximately 2.7 million square miles.", "C": "Deforestation in the Amazon threatens the region\u2019s biodiversity, as well as its role in regulating the global climate.", "D": "The Amazon Rainforest is home to about 10% of the known species on Earth, including a wide variety of plants, animals, and microorganisms.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer. It directly highlights the Amazon Rainforest's biodiversity, focusing on its role as the home to 10% of the known species on Earth. Choice B is incorrect because it emphasizes the size of the Amazon but does not address its biodiversity. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the threat of deforestation but does not emphasize the Amazon\u2019s biodiversity. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the cultural importance of the Amazon, rather than its biodiversity."}
