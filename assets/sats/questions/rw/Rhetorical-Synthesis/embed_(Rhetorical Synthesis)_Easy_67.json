{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the largest coral reef system in the world, covering over 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles). The reef is home to thousands of species of marine life, including fish, corals, mollusks, and marine mammals, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. The Great Barrier Reef plays a critical role in supporting global marine biodiversity, providing habitats and food sources for countless species. In addition to its ecological significance, the reef is also vital to the Australian economy, attracting millions of tourists every year. However, the reef is under significant threat from climate change, pollution, and overfishing, which have caused widespread coral bleaching and damage to marine life.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecological importance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Despite the ongoing threats from climate change and pollution, the Great Barrier Reef remains a vital ecosystem for marine species, supporting biodiversity in the region.", "B": "The Great Barrier Reef, one of the largest coral reef systems, supports a diverse range of marine species and plays a significant role in the Australian economy through tourism.", "C": "The Great Barrier Reef, home to thousands of species of marine life, is an important ecological resource that also contributes to Australia\u2019s economy through tourism.", "D": "The Great Barrier Reef is critical to global marine biodiversity, providing habitats and food sources for countless species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecological importance, focusing on its role in supporting global marine biodiversity and providing habitats and food sources for species, many of which are unique to the reef. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions biodiversity and tourism, it focuses more on the reef's size and economic importance rather than its primary ecological role. Choice C is incorrect because, although it mentions marine life and the economy, it doesn\u2019t focus enough on the reef\u2019s ecological significance as the student intended. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes threats to the reef rather than focusing on its ecological importance, which is the student's goal."}
