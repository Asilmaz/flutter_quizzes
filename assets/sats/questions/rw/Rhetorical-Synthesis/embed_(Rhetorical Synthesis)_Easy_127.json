{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile-long waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, allowing ships to bypass the long and dangerous route around South America. The canal revolutionized global trade by drastically reducing shipping times, saving both time and money, and providing a more efficient route for international shipping. Originally under U.S. control, the canal was transferred to Panama in 1999 under the Panama Canal Treaty, granting Panama full sovereignty over the waterway. In 2016, the canal was expanded to accommodate larger vessels, further increasing its importance in global commerce and facilitating the efficient movement of goods across continents. The Panama Canal continues to be one of the most significant engineering projects in history and plays a central role in international trade today.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Panama Canal\u2019s contribution to global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal revolutionized global trade by providing a more efficient route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, reducing shipping times and costs, and continuing to serve as a key route for international commerce.", "B": "The Panama Canal\u2019s expansion in 2016 allowed for larger vessels to pass, further cementing its role in global trade and increasing its efficiency as a shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "C": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914 and expanded in 2016, transformed global shipping by offering a faster route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, saving both time and money for international trade.", "D": "Despite its transfer to Panama in 1999, the Panama Canal remains an essential part of international trade, providing an efficient and cost-effective route for shipping between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly addresses the Panama Canal\u2019s contribution to global trade by emphasizing its efficiency in reducing shipping times and costs, as well as its continued importance for international commerce. This aligns with the student\u2019s goal to focus on the canal\u2019s impact on trade. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses too heavily on the 2016 expansion, which, while important, doesn\u2019t fully address the canal\u2019s broader contribution to global trade over its entire history. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the expansion and the time savings but doesn\u2019t fully capture the ongoing importance of the canal for trade, as  Choice A does. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes the canal\u2019s transfer to Panama and its continuing role, but it does not focus enough on its specific impact on global trade as effectively as  Choice A."}
