{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most well-preserved archaeological sites from the Inca civilization. The city was built in the 15th century and abandoned in the 16th century, likely due to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. It remained hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery in 1911 by explorer Hiram Bingham. Machu Picchu is known for its impressive stonework, including temples, terraces, and an advanced water management system that showcases the Inca\u2019s engineering expertise. While its exact purpose is still debated, scholars believe it may have been a royal estate or a religious center. Machu Picchu is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and draws millions of tourists annually, who come to admire its beauty and historical significance.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Machu Picchu\u2019s advanced water management system and impressive stonework, including terraces and temples, demonstrate the engineering expertise of the Inca civilization.", "B": "Machu Picchu, with its impressive architecture and location in the Andes, is a testament to the Inca\u2019s ability to build in challenging terrains, showcasing their advanced engineering skills.", "C": "The city of Machu Picchu, built in the 15th century and rediscovered in 1911, features advanced engineering techniques, such as its terraces and water management system.", "D": "Despite its debated purpose, Machu Picchu\u2019s terracing and water management system are significant achievements that reflect the Inca\u2019s sophisticated engineering capabilities.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering achievements, focusing on the advanced water management system and the architectural elements that showcase the Inca's engineering skills. Choice B is incorrect because it mentions the location and architecture but does not provide specific details about the engineering feats like the water management system. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses Machu Picchu\u2019s rediscovery and historical context but doesn\u2019t focus on the engineering achievements as directly as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because while it mentions engineering aspects, it lacks the clear focus on specific features like the water system and stonework found in  Choice A."}
