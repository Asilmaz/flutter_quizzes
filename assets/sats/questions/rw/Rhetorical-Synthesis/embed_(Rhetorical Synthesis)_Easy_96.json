{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticized by many for its unconventional design. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the Chrysler Building in New York City surpassed it in 1930. Despite the initial negative reaction, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, representing Paris\u2019s architectural innovation and cultural significance. In addition to its symbolic importance, the Eiffel Tower has practical uses, such as serving as a radio and television transmission tower. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, drawing millions of tourists annually who come to admire its design and panoramic views of the city.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, initially criticized for its design, is now considered a symbol of Paris\u2019s architectural innovation, showcasing the city\u2019s cultural significance and engineering expertise.", "B": "Despite initial criticism, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most iconic structures in the world, representing Paris\u2019s architectural innovation and attracting millions of visitors each year.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, standing at 1,083 feet tall, was initially controversial but has become a symbol of Paris, admired for its unique design and its role in radio and television transmission.", "D": "Completed in 1889, the Eiffel Tower is an enduring symbol of Paris\u2019s cultural and architectural significance, with its innovative design drawing millions of visitors every year.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice D is the best answer because it directly focuses on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural significance, highlighting both its innovative design and its role as a symbol of Paris, which is the student\u2019s goal. Choice A is incorrect because while it mentions architectural innovation, it focuses too much on the tower\u2019s symbolism and less on its actual design and architectural achievements. Choice B is incorrect because it shifts the focus more toward tourism and iconic status, rather than specifically emphasizing architectural innovation. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the tower\u2019s practical uses (radio and television) but does not focus enough on its architectural and design aspects."}
