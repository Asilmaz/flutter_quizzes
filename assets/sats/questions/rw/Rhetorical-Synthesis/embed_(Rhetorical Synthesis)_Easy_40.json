{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile long waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Isthmus of Panama. The canal has played a crucial role in global trade, shortening the travel distance for ships by eliminating the need to navigate around the southern tip of South America. The canal was initially controlled by the United States, but in 1999, control was handed over to Panama as part of the Panama Canal Treaty. Over the years, the canal has been expanded and modernized to accommodate larger ships, including the completion of the <em>Panama Canal Expansion</em> project in 2016. In addition to its economic importance, the Panama Canal has been the subject of geopolitical interest, as it connects two major bodies of water and provides a strategic shortcut for international shipping.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Panama Canal\u2019s importance for global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Completed in 1914, the Panama Canal is a 51-mile waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and has undergone significant expansions over the years.", "B": "The Panama Canal has significantly impacted global trade by providing a shorter, safer route for ships, helping to eliminate the need for lengthy travel around South America.", "C": "The Panama Canal, originally controlled by the United States, has been a key player in global shipping by offering a shortcut that saves time and resources for international trade.", "D": "The Panama Canal\u2019s strategic location between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has made it a focal point of geopolitical interest, contributing to its historical and modern significance.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Panama Canal's impact on global trade, mentioning the shorter and safer route it provides for ships and its role in eliminating the need for the long journey around South America. Choice B is incorrect because, while it discusses the canal\u2019s size and expansion, it doesn\u2019t focus on its specific importance for global trade. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the canal\u2019s initial control and its general importance for shipping but doesn\u2019t explain the specific role it plays in facilitating global trade. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the geopolitical significance rather than its primary role in global trade."}
