{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, stands at 1,083 feet tall and was initially criticized by many Parisians for its unusual design. Despite this early criticism, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most recognized landmarks in the world and is now a symbol of Paris. The tower was originally built as a temporary structure but was later repurposed for use as a radio transmission tower, helping to revolutionize communication. The Eiffel Tower remains one of the most visited monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year to admire its design and panoramic views of Paris.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s status as a global symbol. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Despite initial criticism, the Eiffel Tower has been repurposed for use as a radio transmission tower and is now one of the most recognized structures in Paris.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower, initially criticized for its design, has become one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, symbolizing Paris and attracting millions of visitors each year.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower was originally built as a temporary structure but has since become an iconic symbol of Paris and one of the most famous landmarks in the world.", "D": "Standing at 1,083 feet, the Eiffel Tower was initially controversial but has since become one of the most visited monuments in the world, representing Paris\u2019s engineering achievements.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s transformation from being criticized to becoming a global symbol of Paris, highlighting its iconic status and the millions of visitors it attracts each year. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses too much on the tower\u2019s functional use as a radio transmission tower, rather than its symbolic role as a global landmark. Choice C is incorrect because, while it mentions the Eiffel Tower\u2019s iconic status, it does not emphasize its broader global symbolism as effectively as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the tower\u2019s height and engineering achievements but does not address its symbolic role in the same way as  Choice A."}
