{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Colosseum, located in Rome, Italy, is one of the most famous landmarks of ancient Roman architecture and engineering. Completed in 80 CE, it could hold up to 50,000 spectators who gathered to watch gladiatorial games, animal hunts, and other public spectacles. The Colosseum was an engineering marvel, featuring a system of passageways, trapdoors, and elevators that allowed for quick and efficient movement of gladiators and animals during events. Over the centuries, the Colosseum has suffered damage from earthquakes and stone robbers but remains a symbol of Rome\u2019s strength and architectural brilliance. Today, the Colosseum is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, drawing millions of visitors each year who come to explore its ruins and learn about its history.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Colosseum\u2019s engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Colosseum, capable of holding 50,000 spectators, was used for gladiatorial games and public spectacles, and remains one of the most iconic symbols of Roman architecture.", "B": "The Colosseum\u2019s innovative design, including passageways, trapdoors, and elevators, demonstrates the advanced engineering skills of ancient Romans, enabling the efficient movement of gladiators and animals.", "C": "The Colosseum\u2019s function as an arena for gladiatorial contests and other events showcases the grandeur of ancient Rome, while its engineering feats, like passageways and trapdoors, helped manage large crowds.", "D": "Though it has been damaged over time, the Colosseum\u2019s architectural features, including its size and design, continue to attract millions of visitors each year to learn about its history.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly highlights the Colosseum\u2019s engineering achievements, focusing on the innovative features such as passageways, trapdoors, and elevators that were integral to its function. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the Colosseum\u2019s size and purpose, it does not emphasize its engineering features as clearly as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses more on the Colosseum\u2019s function and grandeur, while not fully explaining its engineering achievements. Choice D is incorrect because it highlights the Colosseum\u2019s modern status as a tourist attraction but does not focus on its engineering significance."}
