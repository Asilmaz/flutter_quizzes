{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, was initially met with criticism due to its unconventional design, with many Parisians calling it an eyesore. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. Despite the early criticism, the Eiffel Tower has since become one of the most recognizable structures in the world, symbolizing Paris\u2019s architectural innovation and cultural significance. The Eiffel Tower also has practical uses, such as serving as a radio and television transmission tower, contributing to its continued importance in modern communication. Today, it remains one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists who come to admire its design and panoramic views of the city.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, once criticized for its unconventional design, has become a symbol of Paris\u2019s architectural innovation and is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s greatest architectural achievements.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 and initially criticized for its design, has become one of the most recognized landmarks in the world, showcasing Paris\u2019s cultural strength and architectural beauty.", "C": "Despite early criticism, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, symbolizing both Paris\u2019s architectural achievement and its importance in modern communication.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, standing at 1,083 feet tall, was initially controversial but has become a major tourist attraction, admired for its innovative design and stunning views of Paris.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly highlights the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural significance, emphasizing its role as a symbol of Paris\u2019s innovation in design and acknowledging its place as a significant architectural achievement. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses too much on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s symbolism and cultural significance without emphasizing its architectural innovations as clearly as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it brings in the aspect of modern communication, which is less relevant to the student\u2019s focus on architectural achievement. Choice D is incorrect because, although it mentions its design and views, it does not fully focus on the broader architectural significance and innovation of the tower."}
