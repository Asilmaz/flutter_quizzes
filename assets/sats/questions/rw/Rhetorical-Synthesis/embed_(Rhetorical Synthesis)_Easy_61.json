{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is one of the most famous and historically significant man-made structures in the world. It was originally built to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes, acting as both a physical barrier and a symbol of Chinese strength. The wall was constructed over several centuries, with different sections built by various dynasties, including the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. The Great Wall is made from a variety of materials, including stone, earth, and wood, with its design changing to adapt to the different terrains it passed through. While it was effective as a military defense system for many years, the significance of the Great Wall has shifted over time, and it is now a major tourist attraction and cultural symbol.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Great Wall\u2019s historical purpose. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China, made from materials like stone and wood, was designed to protect against nomadic tribes and played a central role in China\u2019s defense for centuries.", "B": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, was constructed by different dynasties and remains a major cultural symbol of China today.", "C": "The Great Wall of China was primarily built to protect China from invasions, serving as both a defense system and a symbol of the country\u2019s strength.", "D": "Though the Great Wall of China was a military defense system for many years, it is now known more as a popular tourist destination and symbol of Chinese history.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly highlights the Great Wall\u2019s original purpose: to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes, while also mentioning its symbolic significance as a representation of strength. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the wall\u2019s cultural significance, it does not focus enough on its historical military function. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the materials and design of the wall but doesn\u2019t clearly focus on its role as a defense system as well as its symbolic meaning. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes the Great Wall's modern tourist status and symbol of history, rather than its historical purpose as a defense system."}
