{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Yellowstone National Park, located in the northwest United States, is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including bison, elk, and grizzly bears. In 1995, gray wolves were reintroduced to the park, marking the beginning of an important ecological restoration effort. Since the reintroduction, the population of gray wolves in the park has stabilized at around 100 individuals, believed to be the park's carrying capacity. Carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of individuals of a species that an environment can sustainably support over time. The park's ecosystem has benefited from the return of gray wolves, which have helped control the populations of other species, such as elk, and improve the health of vegetation.", "question": "The student wants to specify the current population of gray wolves in Yellowstone. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The carrying capacity of Yellowstone\u2019s ecosystem, specifically for gray wolves, is believed to be about 100 individuals, stabilizing the park\u2019s wolf population.", "B": "Gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995, and their population has since been monitored as part of an ongoing ecological study.", "C": "Yellowstone\u2019s reintroduction of gray wolves in 1995 helped restore the park\u2019s ecosystem by controlling elk populations and improving plant health.", "D": "The population of gray wolves in Yellowstone has stabilized at around 100 individuals, believed to be the park\u2019s carrying capacity.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly specifies the current population of gray wolves in Yellowstone, which has stabilized at around 100 individuals. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the reintroduction and monitoring of gray wolves, but it does not state their current population. Choice C is incorrect because it emphasizes the ecological benefits of the wolves' return, but does not focus on the current population. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the carrying capacity but doesn\u2019t give a clear statement about the actual number of gray wolves in the park."}
