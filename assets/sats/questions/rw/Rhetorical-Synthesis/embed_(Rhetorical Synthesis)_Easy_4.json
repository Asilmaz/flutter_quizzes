{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef is located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, and is the world\u2019s largest coral reef system. It is made up of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, stretching over 1,430 miles. The reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to a wide variety of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish and 400 types of coral. The Great Barrier Reef has faced significant threats in recent decades due to climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Recent conservation efforts aim to protect the reef\u2019s biodiversity and restore damaged ecosystems.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize who may have first studied the Great Barrier Reef. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to an incredible diversity of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish and 400 types of coral.", "B": "Located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, the Great Barrier Reef is the world\u2019s largest coral reef system, stretching over 1,400 miles.", "C": "The first recorded scientific study of the Great Barrier Reef took place during the 19th century, though much of its ecological value was unknown at the time.", "D": "Recent conservation efforts aim to protect the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s biodiversity and restore damaged ecosystems.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice D is the best answer because it specifies the first scientific study of the Great Barrier Reef, directly addressing who may have first studied it. Choice A is incorrect because it emphasizes the reef\u2019s biodiversity but does not address who studied it first. Choice B is incorrect because it mentions the location and size of the reef but does not focus on who first studied it. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses conservation efforts, which do not relate to the student\u2019s goal of identifying the first scientific study of the reef."}
