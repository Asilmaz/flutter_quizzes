{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, a 51-mile-long waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, was completed in 1914 and has had a major impact on global trade. By providing a shortcut for ships, the canal drastically reduces travel times, allowing goods to be transported more efficiently between the two oceans. The canal was originally under U.S. control, but in 1999, control was transferred to Panama through the Panama Canal Treaty, granting Panama full sovereignty over the canal. In 2016, the Panama Canal underwent an expansion project to accommodate larger vessels, further enhancing its importance to global shipping and trade. Today, the Panama Canal remains a vital route for international commerce, contributing significantly to global economic growth.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Panama Canal\u2019s contribution to global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal\u2019s expansion in 2016 allowed for larger vessels to pass, which has further improved its role in reducing shipping times and boosting global trade.", "B": "The Panama Canal, a 51-mile-long waterway, has been a major contributor to global trade by providing a faster route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.", "C": "The Panama Canal has played a crucial role in global trade by shortening shipping routes, reducing travel time, and enhancing the efficiency of international commerce.", "D": "Despite its challenges, including political and environmental concerns, the Panama Canal continues to be an essential route for global trade, contributing to economic growth.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly highlights the Panama Canal's key contribution to global trade: shortening shipping routes and improving the efficiency of transporting goods. This captures the central focus of the student\u2019s goal. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the shortcut and reduced travel times, it does not focus on the broader impact on global trade efficiency as effectively as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because, although it mentions the expansion, it focuses more on accommodating larger vessels than on the canal\u2019s overall contribution to global trade efficiency. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses challenges and the broader importance of the canal but does not emphasize its direct impact on trade efficiency in the way that  Choice A does."}
