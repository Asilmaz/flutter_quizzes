{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon Rainforest, located across nine countries in South America, is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering over 2.7 million square miles. The rainforest is home to about 10% of the world\u2019s known species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth, making it one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world. In addition to its biodiversity, the Amazon plays a critical role in regulating the global climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, which is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The Amazon River, flowing through the heart of the rainforest, serves as an important transportation route for local communities and industries. However, the Amazon is under constant threat from deforestation, illegal logging, and climate change, all of which pose serious risks to its biodiversity and its ability to regulate the climate.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Amazon Rainforest\u2019s role in regulating the global climate. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Amazon Rainforest is crucial for regulating the global climate, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, which are essential for life on Earth.", "B": "The Amazon Rainforest\u2019s role in regulating the climate is critical, as it absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, making it essential to global ecological balance.", "C": "The Amazon Rainforest, spanning over 2.7 million square miles, is a vital ecosystem that helps regulate the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.", "D": "Despite facing threats from deforestation and climate change, the Amazon Rainforest continues to play a key role in regulating the Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice C is the best answer because it emphasizes the Amazon Rainforest\u2019s key ecological function in regulating the global climate, specifically its absorption of carbon dioxide and oxygen production, which are central to sustaining life on Earth. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the Amazon\u2019s importance in regulating the global climate but doesn\u2019t mention its role in sustaining global ecological balance, which is central to the student's goal. Choice B is incorrect because it introduces the size of the rainforest but doesn\u2019t directly connect its climate-regulating functions to the importance of ecological balance as effectively as  Choice C. Choice D is incorrect because, while it mentions the threats to the Amazon, it focuses too much on the consequences of these threats rather than its climate-regulating role."}
