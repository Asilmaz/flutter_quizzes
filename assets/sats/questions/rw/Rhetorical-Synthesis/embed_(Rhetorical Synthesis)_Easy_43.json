{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, was designed by Gustave Eiffel and stands at 1,083 feet tall. The tower was initially criticized by many Parisians for its unconventional design but has since become one of the most recognized and beloved landmarks in the world. Over 7 million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year, making it one of the most visited paid monuments in the world. In addition to being an iconic symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower also serves practical purposes, such as broadcasting radio signals and hosting exhibitions. The tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s iconic status. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Despite initial criticism of its design, the Eiffel Tower has become an iconic symbol of Paris, attracting millions of visitors annually and being one of the most recognized landmarks in the world.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower, standing at 1,083 feet, was initially criticized for its design but has since become a beloved symbol of Paris, drawing millions of visitors each year.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, originally completed for the 1889 World\u2019s Fair, serves not only as an iconic symbol of Paris but also as a functional broadcasting tower.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, designed by Gustave Eiffel, was the tallest structure in the world until the Chrysler Building surpassed it in 1930, becoming an essential piece of Parisian architecture.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s iconic status, mentioning how it overcame initial criticism to become a beloved landmark, while also highlighting its global recognition and high visitor numbers. Choice B is incorrect because, while it focuses on the tower\u2019s recognition and the public\u2019s shift in opinion, it doesn\u2019t fully emphasize the tower\u2019s broader iconic status. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the tower's functionality as a broadcasting tower rather than its symbolic status. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses more on the tower\u2019s height and its historical role as the tallest structure, without addressing its current iconic status."}
