{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, was initially criticized for its unconventional design, with many Parisians calling it an eyesore. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. Despite the initial negative reaction, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world, symbolizing Paris\u2019s innovation in architecture and engineering. In addition to its symbolic importance, the Eiffel Tower also serves practical functions, such as a radio and television transmission tower, and contributes to modern communication. Today, it remains one of the most visited monuments in the world, drawing millions of tourists annually who come to admire its design and panoramic views of the city.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural and engineering significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, standing at 1,083 feet tall, was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the Chrysler Building\u2019s completion in 1930, symbolizing Paris\u2019s architectural prowess.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower, originally criticized for its unconventional design, has become a symbol of Paris\u2019s innovation in architecture and engineering, representing a significant achievement in both fields.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, despite initial criticism, showcases Paris\u2019s architectural and engineering innovation, with its design becoming one of the most iconic in the world.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, originally built for the 1889 World's Fair, continues to symbolize Paris\u2019s strength in engineering and architecture, while also serving practical functions in modern communication.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly addresses the Eiffel Tower's architectural and engineering significance, highlighting its role as both a symbol of innovation and a major achievement in these fields. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the tower\u2019s height and significance, it focuses too much on the tower\u2019s role as the tallest structure and does not fully emphasize its architectural and engineering impact. Choice C is incorrect because, while it mentions innovation and icon status, it lacks the specific connection to the achievement in architecture and engineering that  Choice A clearly presents. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes the practical function of the tower and its symbolic significance, but does not focus enough on its architectural and engineering accomplishments."}
