{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Langston Hughes (1902\u20131967) was a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural movement celebrating African American art, literature, and music in the 1920s. Hughes\u2019s poetry is best known for exploring themes of racial pride, identity, and the struggles faced by African Americans during segregation. Some of his most famous works include <em>The Weary Blues</em> (1926) and <em>I, Too</em> (1926), both of which highlight the resilience and beauty of African American culture. In addition to poetry, Hughes wrote plays, essays, and short stories, using his literary voice to advocate for civil rights and social justice. Hughes\u2019s influence extended beyond literature, as he became a symbol of hope and pride for the African American community during a period of intense racial discrimination.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize Hughes\u2019s contributions to literature. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Hughes\u2019s works, such as <em>The Weary Blues</em> and <em>I, Too</em>, highlighted the beauty and resilience of African American culture, making him a literary icon during the Harlem Renaissance.", "B": "Langston Hughes used his poetry, plays, and essays to advocate for civil rights, making him one of the most influential writers of the Harlem Renaissance.", "C": "Langston Hughes, a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance, is renowned for his poetry that explores themes of racial pride and resilience, including works like <em>The Weary Blues</em> and <em>I, Too</em>.", "D": "Langston Hughes\u2019s literary contributions, including poetry and essays, were central to his role as a voice for African Americans and a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it highlights Hughes\u2019s literary contributions, specifically his poetry, and ties them to the themes of racial pride and resilience central to his impact during the Harlem Renaissance. Choice B is incorrect because it emphasizes Hughes\u2019s advocacy for civil rights without fully focusing on his literary contributions. Choice C is incorrect because, while it mentions key works, it doesn\u2019t emphasize his broader contributions to literature as effectively as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses Hughes\u2019s overall role as a voice for African Americans but doesn\u2019t specifically focus on his contributions to literature."}
