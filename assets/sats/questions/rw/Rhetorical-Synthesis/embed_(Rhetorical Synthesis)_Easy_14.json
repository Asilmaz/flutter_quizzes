{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Colosseum, located in the heart of Rome, is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world and a symbol of ancient Roman engineering. It was completed in 80 CE and could hold up to 50,000 spectators, who gathered to watch gladiatorial games, animal hunts, and mock sea battles. The Colosseum was primarily used for public spectacles, but it also served as a venue for executions and dramas. It is considered one of the greatest architectural and engineering feats of ancient Rome, with a complex system of underground tunnels and chambers for holding animals and gladiators. Despite being severely damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers, the Colosseum remains a major tourist attraction in Rome, drawing millions of visitors each year.", "question": "The student wants to highlight the architectural significance of the Colosseum. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Colosseum\u2019s large capacity and use for public spectacles, such as gladiatorial games and animal hunts, made it one of the most popular entertainment venues of its time.", "B": "The Colosseum, completed in 80 CE, could hold up to 50,000 spectators and was used for gladiatorial games and public spectacles.", "C": "Despite earthquakes and stone robbers, the Colosseum continues to draw millions of visitors each year, making it a major tourist attraction.", "D": "The Colosseum is considered one of the greatest architectural feats of ancient Rome, with its complex system of tunnels and chambers for holding gladiators and animals.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Colosseum\u2019s architectural significance, specifically highlighting its complex system of tunnels and chambers. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the capacity and usage of the Colosseum, rather than its architectural features. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the Colosseum\u2019s current status as a tourist attraction, not its architectural importance. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes the Colosseum\u2019s capacity and entertainment functions, rather than its architectural and engineering achievements."}
