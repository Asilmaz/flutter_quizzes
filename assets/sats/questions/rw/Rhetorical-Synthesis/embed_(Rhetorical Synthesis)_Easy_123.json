{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is a well-preserved site from the Inca civilization, believed to have been constructed in the 15th century and abandoned shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The site includes impressive stonework, such as temples, terraces, and an advanced water management system, all of which demonstrate the Inca\u2019s remarkable engineering skills. Though its exact purpose remains uncertain, many scholars believe it was used as a royal estate or a religious center, reflecting the social and cultural significance of the site. Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911 by American explorer Hiram Bingham, and it has since become one of the most iconic archaeological sites in the world, drawing millions of tourists each year.", "question": "The student wants to focus on Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The advanced water management system and sophisticated stone structures at Machu Picchu are prime examples of the Inca\u2019s engineering brilliance, contributing to the site\u2019s enduring historical significance.", "B": "The stonework and terraces at Machu Picchu demonstrate the Inca\u2019s ability to adapt their engineering techniques to different terrains, reflecting the site\u2019s importance as a royal or religious center.", "C": "The advanced water management system and impressive stonework at Machu Picchu showcase the Inca\u2019s engineering expertise, making it one of the most remarkable achievements in ancient construction.", "D": "Despite the uncertainties surrounding its purpose, Machu Picchu remains a testament to Incan engineering, with its advanced water systems and stone structures showcasing the civilization's ability to build in challenging environments.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice C is the best answer because it directly addresses the engineering achievements of Machu Picchu, highlighting both the advanced water management system and the sophisticated stone structures. This choice clearly ties these features to the Inca\u2019s engineering brilliance, which aligns with the student\u2019s goal of focusing on the site\u2019s engineering. Choice A is incorrect because it mentions the engineering feats but does not emphasize the specific role these innovations played in Machu Picchu's design and construction as effectively as  Choice C. Choice B is incorrect because it discusses the site\u2019s cultural importance rather than focusing solely on its engineering achievements. Choice D is incorrect because, while it mentions the engineering features, it doesn't emphasize the complexity and sophistication of the designs as clearly as  Choice C does."}
