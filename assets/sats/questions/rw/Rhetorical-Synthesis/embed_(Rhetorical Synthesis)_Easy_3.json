{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu is an ancient Inca city located high in the Andes Mountains of Peru. It was built in the 15th century and abandoned a century later, around the time of the Spanish conquest of Peru. The site is famous for its sophisticated dry-stone construction, which includes terracing, temples, and an extensive network of stairs. Machu Picchu\u2019s precise purpose is still a matter of debate, though it is believed to have been a royal estate or religious center. It is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, attracting millions of visitors annually.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the construction style of Machu Picchu. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Built in the 15th century and abandoned in the 16th century, Machu Picchu is a famous archaeological site located in Peru.", "B": "Machu Picchu is known for its sophisticated dry-stone construction, including terracing, temples, and an extensive network of stairs.", "C": "Machu Picchu was abandoned around the time of the Spanish conquest of Peru, though its purpose remains a topic of debate.", "D": "The purpose of Machu Picchu is still debated, though many believe it was a royal estate or religious center for the Inca.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes Machu Picchu\u2019s construction style, highlighting the dry-stone techniques, terracing, and the network of stairs. Choice B is incorrect because it mentions the date of construction and the site\u2019s location, but it does not emphasize the construction style. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the abandonment and purpose of Machu Picchu, which doesn\u2019t focus on its construction. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes the purpose of Machu Picchu, not its construction style."}
