{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Channel Tunnel, also known as the Chunnel, is a rail tunnel that connects Folkestone in the United Kingdom to Coquelles in France. It runs beneath the English Channel and is approximately 31 miles long, making it the second-longest tunnel in the world after the Seikan Tunnel in Japan. The Channel Tunnel was completed in 1994 and has significantly reduced travel time between the UK and France, allowing passengers to travel between London and Paris in under 2.5 hours. The tunnel is used by both passenger and freight trains and has become a major component of European transportation infrastructure.", "question": "The student wants to compare the lengths of the Channel Tunnel and the Seikan Tunnel. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Channel Tunnel, completed in 1994, has become a major component of European transportation, while the Seikan Tunnel serves a similar function in Japan.", "B": "The Channel Tunnel connects Folkestone in the UK to Coquelles in France and reduces travel time between London and Paris.", "C": "The Seikan Tunnel in Japan is the longest rail tunnel in the world, measuring approximately 33 miles in length.", "D": "The Channel Tunnel is 31 miles long, slightly shorter than the Seikan Tunnel, which spans about 33 miles.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly compares the lengths of the Channel Tunnel and the Seikan Tunnel, noting that the Channel Tunnel (31 miles) is slightly shorter than the Seikan Tunnel (33 miles). Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the purpose and travel time of the Channel Tunnel, rather than comparing its length to the Seikan Tunnel. Choice C is incorrect because it only mentions the length of the Seikan Tunnel but does not compare it to the Channel Tunnel. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the general function of both tunnels but does not address the comparison of their lengths."}
