	"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:",
	"text": "• Ancient Polynesian navigators traversed vast stretches of the Pacific Ocean.\n• They used observations of stars, ocean swells, and bird flight patterns to guide their voyages.\n• Voyaging canoes carried settlers across thousands of miles to islands like Hawai‘i, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and Aotearoa (New Zealand).\n• Modern experiments with traditional canoes (such as Hōkūle‘a) confirmed the effectiveness of non-instrument navigation.\n• Scholars consider these feats among the most impressive in maritime history.",
	"question": "The student wants to stress how extraordinary ancient Polynesian navigation techniques were. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
	"A": "Ancient Polynesian navigators employed stars and ocean swells for direction when sailing to distant islands.",
	"B": "Modern replicas, like Hōkūle‘a, have confirmed that voyaging canoes are reliable on the high seas.",
	"C": "Guided by celestial and environmental cues, ancient Polynesians reached remote islands over thousands of miles, feats many scholars consider among maritime history’s most remarkable.",
	"D": "Ocean swells and bird patterns helped these navigators choose safe routes, though storms remained a challenge.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C underscores the vast distances traveled using non-instrument methods and includes scholars’ view that these journeys rank among the greatest maritime accomplishments."
