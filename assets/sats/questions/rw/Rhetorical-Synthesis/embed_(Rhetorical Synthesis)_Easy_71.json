{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, completed in the 17th century, stretches over 13,000 miles and was originally constructed to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north. The wall was built over several centuries, with different sections constructed by various Chinese dynasties, including the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. Made from materials like earth, wood, and brick, the design of the wall varied depending on the terrain it passed through. While it was originally used for military defense, the Great Wall has become a symbol of China\u2019s strength and resilience over time. In addition to its military function, the wall also served as a way to control immigration and trade along the Silk Road.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Great Wall\u2019s historical military purpose. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China was primarily built to protect the country from invasions by nomadic tribes, serving as both a defense system and a symbol of strength.", "B": "The Great Wall, initially constructed to defend against northern invasions, has become a symbol of China\u2019s resilience and military prowess.", "C": "The Great Wall of China, completed by various dynasties, served as a military defense system, with its design varying depending on the terrain it passed through.", "D": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, was originally built as a military defense but later evolved into a symbol of national unity and strength.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice B is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Great Wall\u2019s primary military purpose, specifically its role as a defense system and the way its design adapted to different terrains, which is crucial to its historical function. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the wall\u2019s symbolic significance without highlighting the military details as clearly as  Choice B. Choice C is incorrect because, while it mentions defense, it emphasizes symbolism over the wall\u2019s practical military function. Choice D is incorrect because it also mentions the symbolic role of the wall, which is secondary to the student\u2019s focus on its historical military purpose."}
