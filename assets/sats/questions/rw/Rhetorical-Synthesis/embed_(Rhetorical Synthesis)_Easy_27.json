{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "There are several types of muslin fabrics, including Dhaka muslin and sheeting muslin. Dhaka muslin is a high-quality, handmade fabric produced in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is known for its incredibly fine weave and is mainly used for luxury clothing. Sheeting muslin, on the other hand, is a machine-made fabric with a coarser weave and is often used for upholstering furniture and creating backdrops for theater sets. Both types of muslin are woven from cotton, but their differences in weave and production method make them suitable for different uses. Dhaka muslin is prized for its smooth texture and delicate appearance, while sheeting muslin is more durable and suited for practical applications.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the difference between Dhaka muslin and sheeting muslin. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Dhaka muslin, known for its fine weave, is typically used in luxury clothing, while sheeting muslin, with a coarser weave, is used for practical applications like upholstering furniture.", "B": "Dhaka muslin and sheeting muslin are both woven from cotton, but their production methods and weave qualities make them ideal for different types of uses.", "C": "Dhaka muslin is a handmade fabric with an extremely fine weave, while sheeting muslin is machine-made with a coarser weave, making it more suitable for furniture and theater set use.", "D": "Muslin fabrics are versatile, with both Dhaka muslin and sheeting muslin offering various uses based on their weave and texture.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the key difference between the two types of muslin, highlighting the fine weave of Dhaka muslin and the coarser weave of sheeting muslin, and linking these differences to their respective uses. Choice B is incorrect because, while it acknowledges the differences in production methods and weave, it does not directly emphasize the contrast between the two fabrics. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the uses but does not focus on the specific difference in weave and production method. Choice D is incorrect because it broadly mentions versatility without specifically addressing the contrasting qualities of the fabrics."}
