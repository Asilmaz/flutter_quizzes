{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, which stretches over 13,000 miles, was originally built to protect the northern borders of China from invasions by nomadic tribes, especially the Mongols. Construction began as early as the 7th century BCE, and different dynasties, such as the Qin, Han, and Ming, each contributed to the wall's development, using a variety of materials like earth, wood, and brick. The wall\u2019s design adapted to the various terrains it passed through, from deserts to mountains, ensuring its effectiveness as a defensive structure. Though primarily a military defense, the Great Wall also came to symbolize China\u2019s strength and resilience, representing the determination of the Chinese people to defend their land. Today, the Great Wall remains one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, drawing millions of tourists annually who come to admire its scale and historical significance.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Great Wall\u2019s military purpose. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China was built as a military defense to protect against invasions, with its design adapting to various terrains to make it an effective barrier against nomadic tribes.", "B": "The Great Wall of China, built by various dynasties, was primarily a defense system that adapted to different terrains to provide protection against northern invasions.", "C": "The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, was designed to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes, symbolizing China\u2019s strength and resilience.", "D": "Despite its symbolic significance, the Great Wall of China was originally built to defend China from invaders, showcasing the military ingenuity of ancient Chinese engineers.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice C is the best answer because it directly addresses the Great Wall\u2019s military purpose, emphasizing its role as a defense system and its adaptation to different terrains, which were key to its function. Choice A is incorrect because, although it mentions the wall\u2019s military purpose and design adaptation, it does not clearly connect the wall\u2019s function as a symbol of strength and resilience as the student intends. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses more on the symbolic aspects of the wall and its cultural significance, rather than emphasizing its military purpose and design features. Choice D is incorrect because it mentions the symbolic significance too much and doesn\u2019t focus on the wall\u2019s direct military function or its specific design adaptations."}
