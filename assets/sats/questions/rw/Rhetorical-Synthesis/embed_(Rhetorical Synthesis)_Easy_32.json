{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts, making them incredibly fast over short distances. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs have a lightweight build, a flexible spine, long legs, and large nasal passages that allow them to take in more oxygen during high-speed chases. Cheetahs primarily hunt by sprinting after their prey, relying on their speed rather than strength or stealth. Their diet mainly consists of small to medium-sized animals like gazelles. While they are fast, cheetahs are not as strong as other big cats, such as lions or tigers, and have difficulty taking down larger prey. Despite their speed, cheetahs are vulnerable to threats from larger predators like lions, which can steal their kills or even harm them.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize how cheetahs use their bodies to achieve speed. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Cheetahs\u2019 long legs and flexible spines allow them to run at remarkable speeds, though their lightweight build makes them vulnerable to larger predators like lions.", "B": "Unlike other big cats, cheetahs rely on their speed rather than strength to catch prey, making them the fastest land animals.", "C": "Cheetahs primarily hunt small to medium-sized prey and are known for their incredible speed, but they struggle with larger prey due to their relatively weaker build.", "D": "Cheetahs have a lightweight build and specialized body features, such as a flexible spine and long legs, that enable them to achieve incredible speeds over short distances.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it emphasizes the specific body features of the cheetah, such as the lightweight build, flexible spine, and long legs, that enable it to achieve speed. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the cheetah's reliance on speed to catch prey but doesn\u2019t address how its body is adapted to achieve that speed. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on hunting and prey size but does not highlight the cheetah\u2019s physical adaptations for speed. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses more on cheetah vulnerabilities rather than on the key adaptations that allow them to achieve speed."}
