{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair and was originally intended as a temporary structure. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in 1930. Initially criticized by many Parisians for its unconventional design, the Eiffel Tower has since become one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. In addition to its role as a symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower has practical uses, such as serving as a radio and television transmission tower. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year who come to admire its design and views of the city.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s global symbolic significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower\u2019s design, which was controversial at the time of its completion, has since become a celebrated symbol of French innovation and culture.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, was initially intended as a temporary structure but is now one of the most recognized monuments globally.", "C": "Despite initial criticism, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, symbolizing Paris and attracting millions of visitors annually.", "D": "Standing at 1,083 feet tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest structure in the world until 1930 and continues to be a significant tourist destination today.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice C is the best answer because it focuses on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s transformation into a celebrated global symbol, connecting its original controversial design to its current status as a representation of French culture and innovation. Choice A is incorrect because, while it mentions the Eiffel Tower\u2019s iconic status and tourism, it doesn\u2019t emphasize its broader cultural symbolism as effectively as  Choice C. Choice B is incorrect because it discusses the temporary nature of the tower but doesn\u2019t focus enough on its symbolic significance. Choice D is incorrect because it emphasizes the tower\u2019s height and tourist appeal rather than its global symbolic importance."}
