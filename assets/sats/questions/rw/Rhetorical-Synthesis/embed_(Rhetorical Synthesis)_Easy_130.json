{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair and initially received harsh criticism for its unconventional design, with many calling it an eyesore. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed in 1930. Despite the initial negative reaction, the Eiffel Tower has since become one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, symbolizing Paris\u2019s architectural innovation and cultural significance. In addition to its symbolic importance, the Eiffel Tower also serves practical purposes, such as being used for radio and television transmission, which contributed to its continued importance in modern communication. Today, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, drawing millions of tourists each year who come to admire its design and panoramic views of the city.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s architectural and engineering significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, known for its innovative design and engineering, was initially criticized but has since become a symbol of Paris\u2019s architectural prowess and cultural significance.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower, initially controversial due to its unconventional design, demonstrates the architectural and engineering mastery of the 19th century, with its iconic structure now symbolizing Paris\u2019s cultural importance.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower\u2019s design, including its groundbreaking use of iron and its height of 1,083 feet, showcases the engineering ingenuity of the late 19th century, making it a landmark in architectural history.", "D": "Despite its initial criticism, the Eiffel Tower remains a remarkable feat of engineering, with its height and design showcasing Paris\u2019s innovative approach to architecture and modern communication.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice B is the best answer because it directly addresses the architectural and engineering significance of the Eiffel Tower, focusing on its innovative use of iron and its impressive height, which were groundbreaking for the time and highlight the tower\u2019s architectural ingenuity. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the tower\u2019s symbolic significance and public reception, without providing enough emphasis on the engineering and architectural innovations that made it remarkable. Choice C is incorrect because it emphasizes the tower\u2019s symbolic significance and its cultural importance but does not specifically highlight the key engineering features such as the use of iron and height. Choice D is incorrect because, while it mentions the tower's design and engineering, it focuses more on the symbolic aspect and its role in modern communication, rather than focusing clearly on its architectural innovations."}
