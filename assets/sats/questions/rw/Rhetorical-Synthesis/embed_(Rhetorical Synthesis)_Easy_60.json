{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon Rainforest, located in South America, is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering an area of approximately 2.7 million square miles. It is home to about 10% of the world\u2019s known species, including thousands of plant and animal species that are found nowhere else on Earth. The Amazon plays a critical role in regulating the global climate, as it absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide and produces around 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen. In addition to its ecological importance, the Amazon is a crucial resource for the indigenous tribes who live there, many of whom rely on the forest for food, medicine, and shelter. The rainforest faces serious threats from deforestation, illegal logging, and mining, which are rapidly destroying its biodiversity and contributing to climate change.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Amazon Rainforest\u2019s role in regulating the global climate. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Amazon Rainforest\u2019s ability to produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide makes it crucial for maintaining the global climate, in addition to supporting a diverse array of plant and animal life.", "B": "The Amazon Rainforest, covering 2.7 million square miles, is home to 10% of the world\u2019s species and plays an essential role in biodiversity conservation.", "C": "The Amazon Rainforest plays a vital role in regulating the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen, helping stabilize the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.", "D": "Despite the threats from deforestation and climate change, the Amazon continues to provide essential resources to the indigenous tribes living within its borders.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Amazon Rainforest\u2019s crucial role in regulating the global climate, specifically its ability to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, which are central to its climate-regulating function. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions biodiversity, it doesn\u2019t focus on the climate-regulating role of the Amazon as effectively as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the rainforest\u2019s role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide, but it does not emphasize the Amazon\u2019s broader impact on the global climate as clearly as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses more on the rainforest\u2019s role for indigenous communities, not on its global climate-regulating function."}
