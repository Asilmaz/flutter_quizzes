{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. It was built in the 15th century by the Inca civilization and abandoned in the 16th century, possibly due to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. The site is famous for its impressive stonework, including terraces, temples, and an extensive network of stairs that connect different levels of the city. Machu Picchu remained hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery by explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of tourists annually, who come to explore its ruins and marvel at its breathtaking views.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize Machu Picchu\u2019s historical and cultural significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Machu Picchu was built in the 15th century by the Incas and later abandoned, but its unique architecture and breathtaking views continue to captivate visitors.", "B": "The ruins of Machu Picchu, rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911, have become a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year.", "C": "Machu Picchu, built by the Inca civilization and rediscovered in 1911, is one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world, known for its impressive stonework and cultural importance.", "D": "Known for its extensive terraces and temples, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that remains a testament to the engineering skills of the Inca civilization.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it highlights both the historical and cultural significance of Machu Picchu, mentioning its construction by the Inca civilization, its rediscovery, and its importance as an archaeological site. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses too heavily on the site\u2019s modern status as a tourist attraction without emphasizing its historical and cultural significance. Choice C is incorrect because, while it mentions the construction and abandonment, it does not highlight the cultural significance of Machu Picchu as effectively as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the architectural features of Machu Picchu but does not address its historical or cultural importance as a whole."}
