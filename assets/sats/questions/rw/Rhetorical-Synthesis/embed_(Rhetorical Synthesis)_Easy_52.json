In addition to his poetry, Hughes wrote plays, essays, and short stories, and was a strong advocate for civil rights, using his writing to speak out on social justice issues.", "question": "The student wants to focus on Hughes\u2019s contributions to literature.

Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on Hughes\u2019s other literary works (plays, essays, short stories) but does not emphasize his primary contribution to literature: poetry.
