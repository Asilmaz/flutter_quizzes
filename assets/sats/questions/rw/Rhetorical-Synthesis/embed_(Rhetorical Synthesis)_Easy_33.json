{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China, one of the most famous man-made structures in the world, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Originally built to protect against invasions by nomadic tribes, the wall served as both a military defense system and a symbol of Chinese strength. The wall\u2019s construction began as early as the 7th century BCE, with various sections added over the centuries by different Chinese dynasties. Made of brick, stone, and tamped earth, the wall\u2019s design varied depending on the terrain and materials available in different regions. While the wall was initially built as a military defense, its role became less relevant by the 16th century due to changing warfare strategies and the unification of China under the Ming Dynasty.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the original purpose of the Great Wall of China. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China and was constructed over several centuries by different dynasties.", "B": "The Great Wall of China was originally built to protect against invasions by nomadic tribes and served as both a military defense and a symbol of Chinese strength.", "C": "Originally constructed to protect against invasions, the Great Wall of China became less relevant by the 16th century as military strategies evolved.", "D": "The Great Wall of China\u2019s design varies by region, with sections built from materials like brick, stone, and tamped earth, depending on local resources.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it clearly emphasizes the original purpose of the Great Wall: to protect against invasions by nomadic tribes, while also mentioning its military and symbolic roles. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the size and construction but doesn\u2019t address the original purpose of the wall. Choice C is incorrect because while it mentions the diminishing relevance of the wall, it doesn\u2019t emphasize its original purpose. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the wall\u2019s design without focusing on its primary purpose."}
