{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic man-made structures in the world, stretching over 13,000 miles across northern China. Originally built to protect against invasions by nomadic tribes, the wall served as a military defense system, complete with watchtowers and signal fires. The construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BCE, with various sections added over the centuries by different Chinese dynasties. The Great Wall is made of various materials, including earth, wood, and brick, depending on the region and time period. Despite being a symbol of Chinese strength and ingenuity, the wall\u2019s primary function as a military defense became less relevant after the 16th century.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Great Wall\u2019s military function. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Originally constructed to defend against invasions, the Great Wall of China has evolved into a symbol of strength and perseverance over the centuries.", "B": "Stretching over 13,000 miles, the Great Wall of China was constructed over many centuries and is made of materials like brick, earth, and wood.", "C": "The Great Wall of China became less relevant for military defense after the 16th century, though it continued to serve as a symbol of Chinese strength.", "D": "The Great Wall of China was primarily built as a military defense system, complete with watchtowers and signal fires, to protect against invasions by nomadic tribes.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the military function of the Great Wall, highlighting its use of watchtowers and signal fires for defense. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the size and construction of the wall rather than its military purpose. Choice C is incorrect because it mentions the wall\u2019s diminished relevance for defense, but doesn't focus on its primary military function during its construction. Choice D is incorrect because it discusses the wall as a symbol of strength, which does not address its original military function."}
