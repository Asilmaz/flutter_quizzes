{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Colosseum, located in the heart of Rome, is one of the most iconic landmarks of ancient Roman engineering and architecture. It was completed in 80 CE and could hold up to 50,000 spectators who came to watch gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and other public spectacles. The Colosseum was initially built as a venue for public entertainment but later served other purposes, including housing and workshops. Despite being severely damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers, the Colosseum remains one of the most visited tourist attractions in Rome, drawing millions of visitors each year. The Colosseum\u2019s design includes a complex system of passageways, elevators, and trapdoors to facilitate the quick movement of gladiators and animals during events.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Colosseum\u2019s original function. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Despite being damaged by earthquakes, the Colosseum remains one of Rome\u2019s most visited attractions, drawing millions of tourists annually.", "B": "The Colosseum, with its complex design of passageways and elevators, was built to facilitate the movement of gladiators and animals during events.", "C": "The Colosseum was originally built to host public spectacles such as gladiatorial contests and animal hunts, providing entertainment for up to 50,000 spectators.", "D": "The Colosseum was used for various purposes over the centuries, including housing and workshops, but it is most famous for its gladiatorial contests.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Colosseum\u2019s original purpose, which was to host public spectacles such as gladiatorial contests and animal hunts, and mentions its large capacity for spectators. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the logistical design of the Colosseum, but does not emphasize its original function as a venue for public entertainment. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on the Colosseum's modern significance as a tourist attraction, which doesn\u2019t address its original function. Choice D is incorrect because it mentions later uses of the Colosseum, such as housing and workshops, which is not the student\u2019s primary focus on its original purpose."}
