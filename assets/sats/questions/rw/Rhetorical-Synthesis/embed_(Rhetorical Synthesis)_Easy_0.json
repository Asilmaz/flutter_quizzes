{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications built along the northern borders of China. The wall was originally constructed to protect against invasions from nomadic tribes, particularly the Mongols. Construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BCE and continued for several centuries. At its greatest length, the wall stretched over 13,000 miles across China. The wall was built with various materials, including brick, tamped earth, and wood, depending on the region and time period.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the length of the Great Wall of China. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Construction of the Great Wall of China began as early as the 7th century BCE and continued for centuries.", "B": "Originally built to protect against invasions, the Great Wall of China was constructed over many centuries.", "C": "The Great Wall of China was constructed with materials such as brick, wood, and tamped earth, depending on the time period.", "D": "The Great Wall of China, constructed over several centuries, stretches more than 13,000 miles along China\u2019s northern borders.", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer. It directly emphasizes the length of the Great Wall of China, clearly stating that it stretches more than 13,000 miles, as noted in the research. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the purpose of the wall (to protect against invasions), which doesn\u2019t emphasize the length. Choice C is incorrect because it mentions the materials used to build the wall but does not highlight its length. Choice D is incorrect because it mentions the time frame of construction but fails to emphasize the Great Wall\u2019s length, which was the student\u2019s goal."}
