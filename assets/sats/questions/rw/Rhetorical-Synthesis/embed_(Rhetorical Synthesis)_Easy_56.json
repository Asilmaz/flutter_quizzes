{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Great Wall of China is a remarkable feat of ancient engineering, stretching over 13,000 miles across northern China. It was originally built to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes from the north, serving as both a military defense and a symbol of strength. Construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BCE, with various dynasties adding sections over the centuries. Made from a variety of materials such as earth, wood, and brick, the wall's design changed depending on the terrain it passed through. While it was effective as a military defense for many centuries, the wall\u2019s purpose became less relevant by the 16th century due to changing warfare strategies and the unification of China under the Ming Dynasty.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the original purpose of the Great Wall of China. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Great Wall of China was built primarily to protect against invasions from nomadic tribes, serving as a military defense system for many centuries.", "B": "Stretching over 13,000 miles, the Great Wall of China was originally built by various dynasties to protect the country\u2019s northern borders.", "C": "The Great Wall of China\u2019s construction, beginning in the 7th century BCE, was a significant military effort aimed at defending China from northern invaders.", "D": "The Great Wall of China, constructed over several centuries, served as a symbol of Chinese strength and military might but became less relevant by the 16th century.", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it clearly highlights the primary purpose of the Great Wall, which was to protect China from invasions by nomadic tribes, and it emphasizes its role as a military defense system. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses too much on the length of the wall and the dynasties involved without clearly stating its original military purpose. Choice C is incorrect because it discusses the military effort but does not emphasize the primary role of the wall in defense as effectively as  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it mentions the symbolic role of the wall but doesn't focus on its original military purpose."}
