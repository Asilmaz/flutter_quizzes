{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair and stands at 1,083 feet tall. The tower was initially criticized by many Parisians for its unconventional design but has since become one of the most recognized and beloved landmarks in the world. Made of wrought iron, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. Today, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists every year who come to admire its design and view the city from its observation decks. In addition to its role as a symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower also serves as a radio transmission tower, contributing to modern technology.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s significance as a symbol of Paris. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World's Fair and was initially controversial for its design but has since become one of the most recognized landmarks in the world.", "B": "Made of wrought iron, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in 1930.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, initially criticized for its design, has become an iconic symbol of Paris, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to admire its beauty and architectural significance.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, which serves as both a monument and a radio transmission tower, is a popular tourist attraction that symbolizes Paris\u2019s strength and modernity.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s role as an iconic symbol of Paris, highlighting how it overcame initial criticism to become beloved and widely recognized, while also mentioning its role in attracting millions of visitors. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses too much on the tower's height and historical significance without emphasizing its symbolic importance. Choice C is incorrect because, while it mentions the controversy over its design, it doesn\u2019t focus enough on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s symbolic role. Choice D is incorrect because it includes the tower\u2019s functional role as a transmission tower but does not emphasize its status as a symbol of Paris as clearly as  Choice A."}
