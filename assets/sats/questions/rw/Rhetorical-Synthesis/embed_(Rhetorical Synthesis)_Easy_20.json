{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Gregorian calendar, which is the most widely used calendar system today, has 365 days in a typical year, with a leap year occurring every four years. However, because 365 days is not an exact multiple of 7, dates in the Gregorian calendar fall on a different day of the week each year. The Hanke-Henry permanent calendar, developed as an alternative to the Gregorian calendar, has 364 days, which can be evenly divided by 7. This means that, with the Hanke-Henry calendar, dates fall on the same day of the week every year, providing more predictable scheduling.", "question": "The student wants to explain one advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Hanke-Henry permanent calendar is an alternative to the Gregorian calendar, which is used by most of the world today.", "B": "The Gregorian calendar has 365 days, with a leap year added every four years to keep the calendar aligned with the Earth\u2019s orbit.", "C": "The Hanke-Henry calendar, with 364 days, allows dates to fall on the same day of the week each year, providing more predictable scheduling.", "D": "The Hanke-Henry calendar is based on a 364-day year, unlike the Gregorian calendar, which has 365 days.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly explains the advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar, which is that it ensures dates fall on the same day of the week each year, providing more predictable scheduling. Choice B is incorrect because it discusses the structure of the Gregorian calendar but does not highlight the advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar. Choice C is incorrect because it introduces the Hanke-Henry calendar as an alternative without explaining its advantages. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the difference in the number of days between the two calendars but does not explain the key advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar."}
