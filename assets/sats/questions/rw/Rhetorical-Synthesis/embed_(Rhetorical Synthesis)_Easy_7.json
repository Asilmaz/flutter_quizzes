He is best known for his work during the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural movement that celebrated African American culture and arts in the 1920s. Hughes's poems often focus on themes of racial pride, equality, and the struggle for social justice. Some of his best-known works include <em>The Negro Speaks of Rivers</em> (1921), <em>I, Too</em> (1926), and <em>The Weary Blues</em> (1926). Hughes\u2019s writing, which often uses jazz and blues rhythms, gives voice to the experiences of African Americans in a society marked by racial segregation.", "question": "The student wants to introduce Langston Hughes to an audience unfamiliar with his career. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "Langston Hughes, an influential poet during the Harlem Renaissance, is best known for his works that address themes of racial pride and social justice.", "B": "Known for his jazz-influenced poetry, Langston Hughes was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance and wrote about the African American experience.", "C": "Some of Langston Hughes\u2019s best-known works include <em>I, Too</em> and <em>The Weary Blues</em>, which explore the experiences of African Americans in a segregated society.", "D": "Langston Hughes, an African American poet and social activist, wrote during the Harlem Renaissance, a movement that celebrated African American culture.", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice B is the best answer because it introduces Langston Hughes to an audience unfamiliar with his career, highlighting his key role in the Harlem Renaissance and his focus on the African American experience through jazz-influenced poetry. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t fully highlight Hughes\u2019s jazz-influenced style and focuses too narrowly on themes of racial pride and social justice. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses only on specific works and doesn't give a broader introduction to Hughes's career. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t explain Hughes\u2019s significance as a poet or mention his jazz influence, which is central to his work."}
