{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, stands at 1,083 feet tall and was initially criticized by many for its unusual design. Despite the initial negative reaction, the tower has since become one of the most iconic structures in the world, representing Paris\u2019s architectural innovation and cultural significance. The Eiffel Tower was originally intended as a temporary structure, but its usefulness as a radio transmission tower helped secure its place as a permanent landmark. In addition to its cultural significance, the Eiffel Tower continues to play a role in modern technology, particularly in telecommunications and radio broadcasting. Today, it is one of the most visited paid monuments in the world, drawing millions of tourists each year who come to admire its design and panoramic views of the city.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s role as a symbol of innovation and architectural significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, initially criticized for its unconventional design, has become a symbol of Paris\u2019s innovation and architectural significance, representing the city\u2019s cultural strength.", "B": "Despite being intended as a temporary structure, the Eiffel Tower\u2019s role in radio transmission helped solidify its place as a permanent symbol of Paris\u2019s strength and innovation.", "C": "The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889 and initially criticized, has since become one of the world\u2019s most iconic structures, symbolizing both Paris\u2019s cultural significance and its modern engineering achievements.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, now one of the most visited monuments in the world, symbolizes both Paris\u2019s cultural importance and its continuing role in modern technology and communication.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice B is the best answer because it emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s evolution from criticism to cultural and architectural significance, linking its role as a symbol of Paris\u2019s modern engineering achievements. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the cultural significance of the tower but does not fully integrate its architectural and technological contributions as effectively as  Choice B. Choice C is incorrect because it highlights the tower\u2019s function in radio transmission but does not emphasize the broader role it plays in Paris\u2019s cultural and architectural significance. Choice D is incorrect because while it mentions the tower\u2019s role in modern technology, it focuses too much on its tourist status rather than its symbolic value in terms of innovation and architecture."}
