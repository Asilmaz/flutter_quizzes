{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, is a 51-mile-long artificial waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, drastically reducing the travel time for ships. By allowing ships to bypass the long and treacherous route around the southern tip of South America, the canal revolutionized global shipping and trade, saving both time and money. Originally under U.S. control, the Panama Canal was transferred to Panama in 1999 under the Panama Canal Treaty, granting Panama full sovereignty over the canal. In 2016, the canal was expanded to accommodate larger vessels, further increasing its importance for global commerce. The Panama Canal remains one of the most significant engineering projects in history and continues to play a crucial role in international trade.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Panama Canal\u2019s impact on global trade. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Panama Canal has been vital to global trade by drastically reducing travel times and enabling ships to avoid the long journey around South America, making shipping more efficient.", "B": "The Panama Canal, originally controlled by the United States, transformed global commerce by allowing ships to bypass South America, reducing travel times and enhancing shipping efficiency.", "C": "The Panama Canal, originally completed in 1914, revolutionized global shipping by providing a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, saving both time and money.", "D": "The Panama Canal\u2019s expansion in 2016 allowed for larger vessels to pass, making it even more significant to global trade by further improving the efficiency of international shipping.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice B is the best answer because it directly addresses the Panama Canal\u2019s impact on global trade, emphasizing its role in providing a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, thus saving time and money for shipping, which is central to the student\u2019s focus. Choice A is incorrect because, while it mentions the canal\u2019s impact on reducing travel time, it does not emphasize the broader significance of global trade and commerce as clearly as  Choice B does. Choice C is incorrect because, while it touches on the canal\u2019s influence on global commerce, it shifts focus to the political history of the canal\u2019s control rather than its specific trade benefits. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses too much on the expansion in 2016, without providing a broader context of how the canal originally impacted global trade as clearly as  Choice B does."}
