{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "Machu Picchu, located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most famous and well-preserved archaeological sites from the Inca civilization. Built in the 15th century and abandoned in the 16th century, Machu Picchu was not rediscovered until 1911 by the American explorer Hiram Bingham. The site includes remarkable stonework, with structures such as temples, terraces, and an advanced water management system that demonstrates the Inca\u2019s engineering expertise. While the exact purpose of Machu Picchu remains unclear, many scholars believe it may have been a royal estate or a religious center. Today, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors annually who come to admire its historical significance and engineering marvels.", "question": "The student wants to focus on Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering achievements. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The remarkable stonework and advanced water management system at Machu Picchu are prime examples of the Inca\u2019s engineering prowess, contributing to its status as a major archaeological site.", "B": "The water management system and stone structures at Machu Picchu highlight the Inca\u2019s engineering abilities, showcasing their skill in architecture and advanced construction techniques.", "C": "Machu Picchu is an outstanding example of Inca engineering, featuring advanced water management systems, terraces, and precise stonework that demonstrate the Inca\u2019s architectural and engineering expertise.", "D": "Despite its uncertain purpose, Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering marvels, such as its terraces and water management system, are impressive examples of Inca craftsmanship and innovation.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it directly emphasizes Machu Picchu\u2019s engineering achievements, mentioning both the water management system and the terraces, which are key aspects of the Inca\u2019s architectural and engineering prowess. It fully addresses the student\u2019s goal to focus on engineering. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the water management system and stone structures, it does not emphasize both the engineering aspects and their significance in as much detail as  Choice A. Choice C is incorrect because, although it highlights the engineering aspects, it doesn\u2019t make the same strong connection between these features and their importance in Inca architecture and design as  Choice A does. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses more on the symbolism of Machu Picchu and doesn\u2019t place enough emphasis on the specific engineering feats that the student wants to focus on."}
