{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was constructed for the 1889 World's Fair and was initially met with criticism for its unconventional design. Standing at 1,083 feet tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the Chrysler Building in New York City surpassed it in 1930. Despite early criticism, the Eiffel Tower has become one of the most recognizable structures in the world and a global symbol of Paris. In addition to its symbolic importance, the tower serves practical functions, such as being used for radio and television broadcasts. Millions of tourists visit the Eiffel Tower annually to admire its architectural beauty and enjoy panoramic views of Paris from its observation decks.", "question": "The student wants to emphasize the Eiffel Tower\u2019s status as a global symbol. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Eiffel Tower, once criticized for its unconventional design, is now one of the world\u2019s most iconic landmarks, symbolizing Paris and French culture.", "B": "The Eiffel Tower, built for the 1889 World's Fair, was the tallest man-made structure until 1930 and remains a major tourist attraction today.", "C": "Despite initial criticism, the Eiffel Tower has become a symbol of Paris, known for its architectural beauty and the panoramic views it offers to visitors.", "D": "The Eiffel Tower, used for radio and television broadcasts, attracts millions of visitors annually who come to admire its beauty and historical significance.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice C is the best answer because it emphasizes the Eiffel Tower\u2019s status as a global symbol, focusing on its transformation from a controversial design to a widely admired landmark associated with Paris. Choice A is incorrect because, while it mentions its symbolic importance, it doesn\u2019t focus enough on how the Eiffel Tower\u2019s status as a global symbol developed over time. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses more on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s height and role as a tourist destination rather than its global symbolic status. Choice D is incorrect because it highlights its functional uses and appeal to tourists but doesn\u2019t emphasize its symbolic significance."}
