{"introduction": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:", "text": "The Amazon River, flowing across South America for more than 4,000 miles, is the second-longest river in the world. It is home to a vast variety of wildlife, including fish, birds, and mammals, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. The Amazon River basin drains an area of 2.7 million square miles, making it the largest river basin in the world, and plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. In addition to its ecological importance, the river serves as a vital transportation route for goods and people in the region. However, the Amazon is facing significant environmental threats, including deforestation and pollution, which threaten its biodiversity and climate-regulating functions.", "question": "The student wants to focus on the Amazon River\u2019s ecological importance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?", "A": "The Amazon River basin drains 2.7 million square miles, making it the largest river basin in the world, and supports both biodiversity and the global climate.", "B": "The Amazon River, the second-longest in the world, is home to an incredible diversity of species, but it is increasingly threatened by deforestation and pollution.", "C": "The Amazon River is essential for regulating the global climate, as it absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, supporting global biodiversity.", "D": "The Amazon River, known for its biodiversity, also plays a key role in local economies by serving as a transportation route for goods and people.", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice A is the best answer because it clearly emphasizes the Amazon River\u2019s ecological importance, particularly its role in regulating the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, which is central to the student\u2019s focus. Choice B is incorrect because, while it mentions the threats to the Amazon, it doesn\u2019t focus enough on the river\u2019s key ecological role in climate regulation. Choice C is incorrect because although it mentions the river basin\u2019s size and the Amazon's role in both biodiversity and climate regulation, it is less focused on the specific climate-regulating aspects as emphasized in  Choice A. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses too much on the river\u2019s role in local economies rather than its broader ecological functions."}
