The letter had become a part of her, shaping her identity in ways she had never imagined. She had learned to wear it with pride, no longer letting it define her solely by her past mistake.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Hester has become complacent and no longer cares about the impact of her past actions.", "B": "It highlights Hester\u2019s transformation from feeling burdened by the letter to embracing it as part of her identity.", "C": "It illustrates Hester\u2019s ongoing guilt and shame despite her efforts to accept the letter.", "D": "It reflects Hester\u2019s belief that the scarlet letter is a punishment that she must continually endure, no matter how much time passes.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Hester's shift in perspective, where she comes to see the scarlet letter not only as a symbol of her sin but also as a symbol of her strength and resilience.
