{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck (1939). Tom Joad reflects on the changes he has witnessed in his family and in the world around him.", "text": "Tom stood in the doorway, watching the dust settle outside. His family had been through so much\u2014losing their farm, losing their way of life. <u>Before the dust storms and the drought, they had been proud landowners, but now they were just like everyone else, struggling to survive. The land no longer belonged to them; it belonged to the bank, to forces beyond their control.</u> He couldn\u2019t help but wonder where things had gone wrong.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates the Joad family's determination to take back control of their land.", "B": "It highlights the unfairness of the Joad family's situation compared to others.", "C": "It suggests that Tom feels disillusioned with the government and its policies.", "D": "It emphasizes the loss of identity and power that the Joad family has experienced.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion reflects how the Joads have lost not just their land, but their previous sense of identity and power. The land no longer belongs to them, marking a significant shift in their lives.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not directly compare the Joads' situation to others or highlight fairness. Instead, it focuses on their loss.Choice C is incorrect. The underlined portion does not suggest disillusionment with the government, but rather describes the loss of control over their land.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the family\u2019s determination to reclaim the land, only their realization that it no longer belongs to them.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
