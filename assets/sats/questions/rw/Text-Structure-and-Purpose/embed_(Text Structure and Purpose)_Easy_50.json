{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway is reflecting on his interactions with Daisy Buchanan.", "text": "Nick had always admired Daisy from a distance, but after spending more time with her, he began to see the complexities of her character. <u>Daisy was beautiful, yes, but there was something fragile about her, as though her life was built on a foundation that was far less secure than it appeared. The more Nick observed her, the more he realized that Daisy\u2019s charm was also her curse, keeping her trapped in a life she couldn\u2019t fully control.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Nick\u2019s belief that Daisy is a victim of her own beauty and social status.", "B": "It shows Nick\u2019s growing admiration for Daisy\u2019s strength and resilience despite her struggles.", "C": "It illustrates Daisy\u2019s desire to break free from the expectations placed upon her by society.", "D": "It emphasizes how Daisy\u2019s external charm conceals the underlying instability in her life.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights the contrast between Daisy\u2019s outward beauty and the underlying fragility of her life, showing how her charm also serves to mask her inner instability.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize Daisy\u2019s strength but rather her vulnerability, which complicates Nick\u2019s perception of her.Choice C is incorrect. The passage does not focus on Daisy\u2019s desire to break free but on the recognition of her fragile and trapped nature.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Nick\u2019s belief that Daisy is a victim of her beauty and status, but rather on how these qualities hide her deeper struggles.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
