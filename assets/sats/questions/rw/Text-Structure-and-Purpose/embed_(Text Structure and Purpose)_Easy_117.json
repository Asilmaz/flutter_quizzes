{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Lockwood reflects on his interactions with Heathcliff.", "text": "Lockwood had heard much about Heathcliff before meeting him, but he was unprepared for the man\u2019s demeanor. <u>Heathcliff was a man of few words, his face often set in a grim expression. Yet, there was something about him that made Lockwood feel compelled to learn more. Heathcliff\u2019s eyes, though dark and intense, seemed to carry a depth of sorrow, as if he had lived through unbearable loss. Lockwood couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had shaped such a solitary, intense figure.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Lockwood is becoming increasingly suspicious of Heathcliff\u2019s motives and is questioning his intentions.", "B": "It highlights Lockwood\u2019s curiosity about Heathcliff\u2019s past and his growing desire to understand the reasons behind his enigmatic nature.", "C": "It illustrates Lockwood\u2019s belief that Heathcliff\u2019s dark demeanor is a reflection of his unrelenting bitterness and anger.", "D": "It reflects Lockwood\u2019s admiration for Heathcliff\u2019s ability to hide his emotions and maintain control in every situation.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Lockwood's curiosity about the complexity of Heathcliff\u2019s character, particularly his sorrow and enigmatic nature.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest Lockwood is becoming suspicious of Heathcliff, but rather intrigued by his depth.Choice C is incorrect because although Heathcliff\u2019s demeanor may suggest bitterness, the passage focuses more on Lockwood\u2019s curiosity than his interpretation of anger or bitterness.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not highlight Lockwood\u2019s admiration for Heathcliff\u2019s emotional control, but rather his fascination with the man\u2019s sorrow and depth.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
