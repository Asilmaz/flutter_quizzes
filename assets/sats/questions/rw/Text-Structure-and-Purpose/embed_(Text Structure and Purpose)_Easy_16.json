Tom reflects on his adventures and the friendships he\u2019s formed.", "text": "Tom had always been a curious boy, and over the years, he had met many people who seemed to understand him better than anyone else. <u>One of those people was Huck Finn, a boy who, like Tom, lived life on his own terms. They had become fast friends, bound by their love for adventure and their defiance of rules.</u> Together, they had explored caves, explored the riverbanks, and lived out the kind of life that most children only dreamed about.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Tom\u2019s tendency to make friends who encourage his rebellious nature.", "B": "It emphasizes the strong bond between Tom and Huck based on their shared sense of independence.", "C": "It illustrates how Tom views Huck as a role model for his adventurous spirit.", "D": "It suggests that Tom and Huck are frequently in trouble because of their defiance of authority.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes the strong bond between Tom and Huck, built on their shared love of adventure and defiance of rules. This mutual understanding is central to their friendship.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Tom\u2019s friends encourage his rebellious nature; it focuses on the shared traits between Tom and Huck.Choice C is incorrect. The passage does not position Huck as a role model for Tom; instead, it highlights their equal bond and shared interests.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not focus on the trouble they get into but rather on their friendship and love for adventure.Let me know if you'd like more questions or adjustments!"}
