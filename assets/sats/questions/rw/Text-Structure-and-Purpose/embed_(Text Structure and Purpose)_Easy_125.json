Yet, despite his gruffness, Lockwood began to sense a profound sadness in him, as though his bitterness was the result of deep emotional pain. Lockwood could not help but wonder what had shaped such a complex and solitary figure.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Lockwood\u2019s belief that Heathcliff\u2019s bitterness is simply a defense mechanism to protect himself from others.", "B": "It suggests that Lockwood is starting to feel sympathy for Heathcliff and is moved by the sadness he perceives in him.", "C": "It emphasizes Lockwood\u2019s curiosity about Heathcliff\u2019s past and his desire to understand the deeper emotional forces that shape his character.", "D": "It illustrates Lockwood\u2019s growing frustration with Heathcliff\u2019s behavior, leading him to question whether they can have a meaningful relationship.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Lockwood\u2019s curiosity and desire to understand the reasons behind Heathcliff\u2019s bitterness, showing his growing interest in the emotional complexity of the character.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t suggest that Lockwood feels sympathy for Heathcliff; instead, it highlights his curiosity about the cause of Heathcliff's bitterness.Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus on a specific defense mechanism but rather on the sadness that Lockwood perceives in Heathcliff, prompting his curiosity.Choice D is incorrect because while Lockwood is intrigued by Heathcliff, there is no suggestion of frustration or a desire to distance himself from him. Instead, Lockwood is focused on understanding him better.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
