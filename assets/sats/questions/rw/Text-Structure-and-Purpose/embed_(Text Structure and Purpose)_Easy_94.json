{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850). Hester Prynne reflects on her experience wearing the scarlet letter.", "text": "Hester Prynne had been living with the scarlet letter for years, enduring the public shame it symbolized. <u>Over time, however, the letter took on new meaning for her. It no longer simply represented her sin; it became a mark of her resilience and strength. People began to see her differently as well, and the letter, once a symbol of disgrace, became a symbol of her ability to endure and rise above her punishment.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects how Hester feels that she has earned redemption for her sin through her suffering.", "B": "It suggests that Hester is beginning to feel that the letter no longer matters, and she has grown indifferent to it.", "C": "It highlights Hester\u2019s transformation, showing how the scarlet letter evolves from a symbol of shame to one of strength and resilience.", "D": "It emphasizes Hester\u2019s desire to challenge society's judgment and prove that the letter no longer holds any power over her.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes how the scarlet letter evolves in Hester\u2019s mind from a symbol of shame to one representing her strength and ability to endure.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest Hester is indifferent to the letter, but rather that it has become a symbol of her personal transformation.Choice C is incorrect because while Hester has endured suffering, the passage does not suggest she believes that suffering has led to redemption.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus on Hester\u2019s desire to challenge society\u2019s judgment but rather on how the letter has taken on new meaning for her personally.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
