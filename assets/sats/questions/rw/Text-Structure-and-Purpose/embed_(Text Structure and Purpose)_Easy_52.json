{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet is reflecting on her feelings toward Mr. Darcy.", "text": "Elizabeth had spent weeks thinking about Mr. Darcy. His arrogance and pride had initially repelled her, but as she learned more about him, her feelings began to change. <u>She realized that beneath his reserved exterior, he was a man of strong principles and deep affection for those he cared about. It was his quiet acts of kindness, rather than his words, that made her see him in a new light.</u> Elizabeth found herself starting to admire him, though she was still cautious about fully trusting him.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights the contrast between Darcy\u2019s outward pride and his inner kindness, which Elizabeth comes to appreciate.", "B": "It shows that Elizabeth has fully forgiven Darcy for his previous behavior and is ready to trust him.", "C": "It suggests that Elizabeth admires Darcy's ability to hide his true feelings from others.", "D": "It reflects Elizabeth\u2019s ongoing skepticism about Darcy\u2019s true nature despite her growing affection.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion illustrates how Elizabeth begins to see beyond Darcy\u2019s outward pride and acknowledges the kindness he shows through his actions, which shifts her perception of him.Choice B is incorrect because while Elizabeth is beginning to admire Darcy, she is still cautious and not yet ready to fully trust him, as shown later in the passage.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Darcy hiding his feelings but on the way his actions reveal his true nature to Elizabeth.Choice D is incorrect because the passage highlights Elizabeth\u2019s growing admiration for Darcy\u2019s kindness, not her skepticism.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
