{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (1960). Scout Finch reflects on her experiences in Maycomb, Alabama.", "text": "Scout had grown up in the small town of Maycomb, and she had always felt safe and loved by her family. <u>But as she grew older, she began to notice the deep divisions in the town, particularly in the way people treated others based on race and class. Her father, Atticus Finch, had always been a model of fairness and justice, and Scout found herself questioning the world around her. She realized that her understanding of what was right and wrong was not as simple as she had once believed.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates that Scout is becoming increasingly frustrated with the limitations of her small-town life and is yearning for something more.", "B": "It suggests that Scout is starting to distrust her father's values and the way he teaches her right from wrong.", "C": "It highlights Scout's growing awareness of the complexities of morality and social justice in her community.", "D": "It reflects Scout\u2019s belief that she must challenge the values of her community in order to form her own understanding of morality.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Scout\u2019s growing realization that the issues of race and class in Maycomb are more complex than she had originally thought, leading her to question her previous beliefs.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Scout distrusts her father, but rather that she is starting to see the complexities of the world he is trying to guide her through.Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus on Scout\u2019s frustration with small-town life but on her evolving understanding of social justice and morality.Choice D is incorrect because while Scout is questioning her world, the passage does not suggest she intends to challenge her community\u2019s values, but rather to understand them more deeply.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
