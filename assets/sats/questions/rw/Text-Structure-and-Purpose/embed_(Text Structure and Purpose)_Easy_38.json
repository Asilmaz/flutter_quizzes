{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle (1892). Dr. Watson is reflecting on Sherlock Holmes's remarkable abilities.", "text": "Dr. Watson had seen many extraordinary things in his time with Holmes, but he was still often astonished by Holmes\u2019s ability to solve cases with so little evidence. <u>It was as if Holmes could see things that no one else could, as though he could read minds and predict actions before they even happened. His intellect seemed almost supernatural in its precision.</u> Watson couldn\u2019t help but admire his friend's brilliance, even if it was difficult to fully comprehend.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Watson\u2019s growing frustration with Holmes\u2019s mysterious nature.", "B": "It illustrates Watson's confusion about how Holmes manages to solve cases so effectively.", "C": "It suggests that Watson is becoming increasingly skeptical about Holmes\u2019s methods.", "D": "It emphasizes Holmes\u2019s extraordinary intellectual abilities and the awe they inspire in Watson.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion describes Holmes\u2019s extraordinary intellect, which seems almost supernatural to Watson. This creates an image of Holmes as a brilliant, almost otherworldly detective.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not describe Watson\u2019s confusion about how Holmes solves cases, but rather his admiration for Holmes\u2019s abilities.Choice C is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that Watson is skeptical; rather, he admires Holmes's intellectual power, even if he doesn\u2019t fully understand it.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t mention Watson\u2019s frustration with Holmes\u2019s mysterious nature, but rather his admiration.Let me know if you need more questions or adjustments!"}
