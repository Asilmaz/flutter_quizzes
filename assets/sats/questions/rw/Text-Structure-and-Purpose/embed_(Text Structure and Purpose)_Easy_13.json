{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway, the narrator, is reflecting on the significance of Gatsby's parties.", "text": "The parties at Gatsby's mansion were legendary. They seemed to go on forever, with people coming and going, dancing, and drinking into the early hours of the morning. <u>But behind all the glitter and glamour, there was an emptiness that was hard to ignore. Despite the extravagance, there was something missing, something that no amount of luxury could fill.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes the superficial nature of the parties at Gatsby's mansion.", "B": "It suggests that the extravagance of the parties fails to provide true happiness.", "C": "It highlights Gatsby\u2019s inability to create lasting relationships with his guests.", "D": "It reflects Nick's growing sense of disillusionment with the lifestyle around him.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because the underlined portion points out that, despite the lavishness and luxury of Gatsby\u2019s parties, something is missing, implying that material wealth and extravagance cannot bring true fulfillment or happiness.Choice A is incorrect because although the passage describes the parties as glittering and glamorous, the underlined portion focuses on the emptiness behind them, not just the superficiality.Choice B is incorrect. The passage does not specifically mention Gatsby\u2019s failure to form relationships; it emphasizes the overall emptiness of the experience.Choice D is incorrect because Nick\u2019s disillusionment is not the central focus of the underlined portion, which more directly critiques the empty nature of the parties.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
