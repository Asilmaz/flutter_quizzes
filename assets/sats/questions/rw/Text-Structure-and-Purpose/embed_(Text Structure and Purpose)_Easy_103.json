{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818). Victor Frankenstein reflects on the creation of his monster.", "text": "Victor had dedicated his life to scientific exploration, but when he saw the creature he had brought to life, he was filled with horror and regret. <u>The monster\u2019s grotesque appearance was beyond anything Victor had imagined. Though he had worked tirelessly to create life, he now felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and fear. He realized that he had unleashed something uncontrollable, and that his ambition had led him to create a being that was both monstrous and tragic.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Victor\u2019s sense of guilt and regret, showing how his ambition led to unintended consequences.", "B": "It reflects Victor\u2019s belief that the monster is an abomination and must be destroyed immediately.", "C": "It illustrates Victor\u2019s realization that the monster\u2019s appearance is more important than its potential to experience emotions.", "D": "It highlights Victor\u2019s fear that the monster will become a threat to society and that he must hide it from others.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Victor\u2019s deep sense of guilt and the realization that his unchecked ambition led to the creation of something he now sees as uncontrollable and tragic.Choice B is incorrect because while Victor is horrified, the passage does not focus on him thinking the monster must be destroyed but rather on his regret for creating it.Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t emphasize the monster\u2019s appearance over its emotional capacity but instead focuses on Victor\u2019s internal conflict about the consequences of his actions.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t suggest that Victor fears the monster as a societal threat in this portion but rather focuses on his internal guilt and horror.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
