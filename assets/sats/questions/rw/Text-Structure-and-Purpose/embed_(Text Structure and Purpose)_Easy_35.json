{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway reflects on his first impression of Gatsby.", "text": "Nick first saw Gatsby from a distance at one of his famous parties. The man was standing alone, looking out at the water with an intensity that seemed to consume him. <u>There was something almost tragic about him, like a man who had everything but was still yearning for something just beyond his reach.</u> Nick couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of life had led Gatsby to this point.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Gatsby is content with his wealth and status but still searching for something more.", "B": "It emphasizes Gatsby\u2019s sense of loss and the unattainable nature of his desires.", "C": "It illustrates Gatsby\u2019s disillusionment with the life he has built for himself.", "D": "It reflects Nick\u2019s growing curiosity about the mysterious aspects of Gatsby\u2019s life.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion underscores Gatsby\u2019s yearning for something beyond his reach, emphasizing the sense of loss and unfulfilled desire that marks his character.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Gatsby is content, but rather that he is yearning for something he cannot attain.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not focus on disillusionment but on Gatsby's longing for something elusive.Choice D is incorrect because, while Nick is curious, the underlined portion focuses more on Gatsby\u2019s inner longing than on Nick\u2019s curiosity.Let me know if you\u2019d like more examples or adjustments!"}
