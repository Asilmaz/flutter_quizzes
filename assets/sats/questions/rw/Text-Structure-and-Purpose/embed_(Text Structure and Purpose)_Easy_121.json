{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818). Victor Frankenstein reflects on his creation of the monster.", "text": "Victor had spent years studying and experimenting in secret, determined to bring life to the dead. <u>When he finally succeeded and saw the creature open its eyes, he was horrified by the result. The monster's appearance was far from what Victor had imagined\u2014it was grotesque and unnatural. Victor immediately regretted his actions, feeling both fear and disgust. He realized that in his pursuit of knowledge, he had created something monstrous, both in appearance and in its consequences.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Victor\u2019s belief that his creation represents the dangers of unchecked ambition and the moral consequences of scientific progress.", "B": "It suggests that Victor is beginning to doubt the scientific principles that led to his experiment, questioning the ethics of his actions.", "C": "It emphasizes Victor\u2019s immediate reaction of horror and regret upon seeing the monster, showing the unintended consequences of his ambition.", "D": "It highlights Victor\u2019s growing anger toward the creature for failing to live up to his expectations and becoming a disappointment.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Victor\u2019s immediate sense of horror and regret, emphasizing the negative consequences of his ambition and the unintended result of his experiment.Choice B is incorrect because while Victor feels regret, the passage doesn\u2019t suggest that he doubts the scientific principles of his work\u2014he\u2019s focused on his emotional response to the creature.Choice C is incorrect because, while Victor recognizes the consequences of his actions, the passage focuses on his emotional reaction (fear and disgust), not a broader philosophical reflection on ambition or scientific progress.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Victor is angry at the creature for failing to meet his expectations; instead, he is horrified and regretful about what he has created.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
