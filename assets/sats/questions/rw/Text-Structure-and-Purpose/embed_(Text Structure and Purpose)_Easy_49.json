{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb (1847). Jane reflects on her feelings toward Mr. Rochester after a pivotal moment in their relationship.", "text": "Jane had always been cautious with her emotions, but Mr. Rochester\u2019s presence stirred something in her that she couldn\u2019t quite explain. <u>She had never felt such a strong pull toward anyone before, and yet she was afraid that giving in to her feelings might lead to heartbreak. The idea of being vulnerable, of allowing herself to care deeply for someone who might not feel the same, terrified her.</u> Jane wondered if love was worth the risk.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Jane\u2019s belief that love is an inevitable part of life, regardless of the risks.", "B": "It suggests that Jane is falling deeply in love with Mr. Rochester and is ready to act on her feelings.", "C": "It shows Jane\u2019s fear of emotional vulnerability and the consequences of loving someone who might not reciprocate.", "D": "It reflects Jane\u2019s growing affection for Mr. Rochester, despite her initial reluctance.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Jane's fear of emotional vulnerability. She is afraid of giving in to her feelings for Mr. Rochester because of the potential heartbreak, which reflects her internal struggle with vulnerability.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Jane is already deeply in love or ready to act on her feelings; instead, it shows her hesitation.Choice C is incorrect because the passage focuses on Jane\u2019s fear and caution, not on her belief that love is inevitable.Choice D is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Jane's fear, not the growth of affection or the decision to act on it.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
