{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett (1911). Mary Lennox, the protagonist, reflects on her first visit to the secret garden.", "text": "Mary was surprised by how the garden made her feel. She had never seen such a place before, and it seemed to be alive with possibility. <u>As she knelt to touch the soil, she felt an unfamiliar sense of peace, something she had never experienced before in her life.</u> The quiet beauty of the garden soothed her in a way that she couldn't quite understand.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes how the garden offers Mary a sense of calm that she has never known before.", "B": "It illustrates Mary\u2019s growing curiosity about the garden and its potential.", "C": "It suggests that Mary is becoming more comfortable with nature after her visit to the garden.", "D": "It highlights Mary's confusion about the garden's effect on her emotions.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes the unfamiliar sense of peace Mary feels in the garden, highlighting the profound emotional effect the garden has on her.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus on curiosity about the garden, but on the peace Mary feels when she is in it.Choice C is incorrect because while Mary feels a sense of peace, the passage doesn\u2019t indicate that she is becoming more comfortable with nature in general, just that the garden affects her emotionally.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest confusion; rather, it describes how Mary feels something new and positive in the garden.Let me know if you'd like more questions or adjustments!"}
