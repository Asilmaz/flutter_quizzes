{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger (1951). Holden Caulfield reflects on his feelings about adulthood and the people around him.", "text": "Holden had always felt disconnected from the world of adults. He saw them as fake and hypocritical, always pretending to be something they weren\u2019t. <u>Yet, as he observed their behavior, he began to see that they, too, were struggling with their own uncertainties and disappointments. Holden couldn\u2019t help but wonder if adulthood was just another stage of pretending, only more complicated and less genuine.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows that Holden is becoming more disillusioned with the idea of adulthood and the complexity it brings.", "B": "It suggests that Holden is starting to feel more sympathy for adults and their struggles.", "C": "It highlights Holden\u2019s growing realization that adults are not as simple and fake as he once believed.", "D": "It reflects Holden\u2019s belief that adulthood is a phase of life that everyone must go through, regardless of their feelings.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows that Holden, while critical of adults, is starting to understand that their lives are just as complicated and uncertain as his, challenging his earlier views.Choice B is incorrect because while Holden observes adults' struggles, the passage doesn\u2019t show him feeling sympathy, but rather pondering the complexity of adulthood.Choice C is incorrect because although Holden is critical, he is not becoming more disillusioned, but is beginning to understand the challenges adults face.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t suggest Holden believes adulthood is something everyone must go through; it focuses on his critical reflection on the nature of adulthood.Let me know if you need any more examples or adjustments!"}
