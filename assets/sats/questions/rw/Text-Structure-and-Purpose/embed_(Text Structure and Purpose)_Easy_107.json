{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on his life and the effect his portrait has had on him.", "text": "Dorian Gray had always been admired for his beauty, but as the years went by, he grew increasingly obsessed with the idea of preserving his youth. <u>His portrait, hidden away in a room, began to show the signs of his indulgent lifestyle, while Dorian remained youthful and untouched. Dorian was both fascinated and terrified by the portrait, wondering how long he could keep up the facade. The more he looked at the painting, the more he felt as though it was a reflection of his soul, changing and decaying with every sin he committed.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Dorian's growing fear that his outward appearance will eventually betray the consequences of his actions.", "B": "It reflects Dorian's increasing satisfaction with his ability to maintain his perfect appearance while avoiding the consequences of his behavior.", "C": "It suggests that Dorian believes the portrait is the true representation of his character, while his physical appearance is an illusion.", "D": "It highlights Dorian\u2019s realization that his youth will eventually fade, and he must find a way to escape the inevitable consequences of aging.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion reveals Dorian\u2019s fear that his physical appearance will eventually be at odds with the changes in his portrait, which represents the consequences of his actions.Choice B is incorrect because Dorian's fear of the portrait decaying reflects his anxiety, not satisfaction with his ability to avoid consequences.Choice C is incorrect because while Dorian sees the portrait as connected to his soul, he doesn\u2019t believe it represents his true character\u2014it reflects the corruption caused by his actions.Choice D is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Dorian's fear of his actions being revealed in the portrait, not a belief that his youth will eventually fade in a natural sense.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
