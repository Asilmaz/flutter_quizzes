{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her feelings about Mr. Darcy after learning more about him.", "text": "Elizabeth had initially been repelled by Mr. Darcy\u2019s pride and apparent arrogance. <u>But as she got to know him better, she began to see a different side of him. Beneath his aloof exterior, Elizabeth realized that Mr. Darcy was not only a man of integrity but also one capable of great kindness and generosity. The more she learned about him, the more she found herself reassessing her previous judgments.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Elizabeth\u2019s growing admiration for Mr. Darcy\u2019s wealth and social status rather than his character.", "B": "It suggests that Elizabeth is beginning to doubt her initial judgment of Mr. Darcy and feels conflicted about him.", "C": "It emphasizes Elizabeth\u2019s changing perception of Mr. Darcy, highlighting her growing understanding of his true character.", "D": "It reflects Elizabeth\u2019s belief that Mr. Darcy's behavior is a result of his upbringing and societal expectations.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes how Elizabeth's perception of Mr. Darcy changes as she sees past his exterior and begins to understand his true character.Choice B is incorrect because, while Elizabeth is reassessing her judgment, the passage does not focus on her feeling conflicted about him but rather on her deeper understanding of his nature.Choice C is incorrect because the passage focuses on Elizabeth\u2019s evolving view of Mr. Darcy's character, not his wealth or status.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Elizabeth attributes Mr. Darcy's behavior to his upbringing but rather to her growing understanding of him as a person.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
