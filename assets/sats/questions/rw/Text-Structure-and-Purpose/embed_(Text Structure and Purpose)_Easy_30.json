{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on his changing relationship with his portrait.", "text": "Dorian stared at the painting, a reflection of his youthful face and charm. As the years passed, the portrait remained unchanged, while he, in the midst of indulgence and excess, grew older. <u>The more he lived a life of pleasure and indulgence, the more he felt that the portrait became a prison, locking away the truth of his actions.</u> He knew that the painting held a secret he couldn\u2019t escape.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Dorian\u2019s fear that others might discover his secret.", "B": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s increasing discomfort with the effects of his hedonistic lifestyle.", "C": "It suggests that Dorian feels the portrait is a reflection of his true self.", "D": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s growing desire to destroy the portrait as a way of escaping his guilt.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion reveals Dorian's sense of being trapped by the portrait, which serves as a reminder of his increasingly indulgent and corrupt lifestyle. The portrait metaphorically locks away the truth, indicating his discomfort.Choice B is incorrect. While Dorian is aware of the portrait's secret, the passage doesn't emphasize his fear of others discovering it, but rather his internal struggle with the consequences of his actions.Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn't suggest that Dorian sees the portrait as an accurate reflection of his true self, but rather a symbol of the contrast between his outward appearance and inner corruption.Choice D is incorrect. The passage does not indicate that Dorian desires to destroy the portrait, but focuses on his discomfort with how it reflects his hidden truth.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
