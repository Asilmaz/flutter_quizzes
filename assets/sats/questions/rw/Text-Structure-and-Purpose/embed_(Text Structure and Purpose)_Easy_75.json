{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Lockwood reflects on his interactions with Heathcliff.", "text": "Lockwood had been spending more time at Wuthering Heights, observing Heathcliff from a distance. <u>Heathcliff\u2019s manner was cold, his speech often blunt, yet there was an intensity to his character that fascinated Lockwood. The more Lockwood saw of him, the more he realized that Heathcliff\u2019s bitterness was a mask for something deeper, something rooted in his past. Despite his rough exterior, there was an undeniable complexity to the man.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Lockwood\u2019s frustration with Heathcliff\u2019s behavior, making him unsure of how to interact with him.", "B": "It suggests that Lockwood feels pity for Heathcliff\u2019s bitterness and wants to help him overcome his emotional pain.", "C": "It emphasizes Lockwood's growing curiosity about the complexities of Heathcliff\u2019s character and the mystery surrounding him.", "D": "It reflects Lockwood\u2019s belief that Heathcliff\u2019s bitterness is simply the result of his difficult upbringing.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Lockwood's increasing intrigue in Heathcliff's complex character, indicating a fascination with the layers beneath his outward bitterness.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not show Lockwood feeling pity for Heathcliff, but rather a growing curiosity about his deeper emotional complexity.Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t emphasize Lockwood\u2019s frustration with Heathcliff, but rather his fascination with him and his complexity.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Lockwood believes Heathcliff's bitterness is simply the result of his upbringing, but rather points to a more complicated emotional depth.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
