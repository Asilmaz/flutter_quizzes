{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck (1939). Tom Joad, the protagonist, reflects on his family's hardships during the Great Depression.", "text": "Tom sat silently, his mind racing over all that had happened. <u>The Joads had lost their farm, their livelihood, their home.</u> They had nothing left but the clothes on their backs and the hope that perhaps, out there in California, a new life awaited them.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Tom is beginning to lose hope for the future.", "B": "It describes the specific losses that Tom is thinking about.", "C": "It emphasizes the hardships that the Joad family has endured.", "D": "It highlights the strength of the Joad family in the face of adversity.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion outlines the major losses the Joad family has experienced, emphasizing the magnitude of their struggles.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not list specific details beyond the general loss of their farm, livelihood, and home.Choice C is incorrect. Although Tom is reflecting on the losses, there is no indication that he is losing hope, as the passage also mentions his remaining hope for the future in California.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize strength, but rather the sense of profound loss that Tom and his family are enduring.Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!"}
