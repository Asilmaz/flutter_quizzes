{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her relationship with Mr. Darcy.", "text": "Elizabeth was not blind to the differences between her family and Mr. Darcy\u2019s, but she was determined not to let them stand in the way of her feelings. She knew that they had both struggled with their pride, but in different ways. <u>As much as she tried to resist it, Elizabeth found herself falling for him, even more than she ever expected.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Elizabeth\u2019s reluctance to admit her feelings for Mr. Darcy.", "B": "It reveals that Elizabeth is beginning to admire Mr. Darcy for his character.", "C": "It shows Elizabeth\u2019s internal conflict between her pride and her growing feelings for Mr. Darcy.", "D": "It highlights Elizabeth\u2019s surprise at how deeply her feelings for Mr. Darcy have developed.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Elizabeth\u2019s surprise at how deeply her feelings for Mr. Darcy have grown, despite her initial resistance. This reflects her unexpected emotional development.Choice A is incorrect because while Elizabeth is trying to resist her feelings, the underlined portion does not focus on her reluctance, but on the depth of her feelings that she cannot deny.Choice B is incorrect. The underlined sentence does not show admiration for Mr. Darcy\u2019s character; rather, it focuses on the intensity of Elizabeth\u2019s feelings, which are more emotional than based on his character.Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion does not describe an internal conflict between Elizabeth\u2019s pride and feelings, but her emotional response to Darcy\u2019s charm and qualities.Let me know if you need more questions or adjustments!"}
