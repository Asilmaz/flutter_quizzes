{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle (1892). Dr. Watson reflects on Sherlock Holmes's methods.", "text": "Dr. Watson had accompanied Sherlock Holmes on many cases, but he was still often amazed by Holmes\u2019s methods. <u>Holmes could solve mysteries with a few subtle observations, noticing things that no one else would. But there was something unsettling about his ability to read people so easily, as though he could see right through them. While Watson admired his intellect, he sometimes wondered whether Holmes\u2019s sharp mind made him too detached from human emotion and compassion.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Watson\u2019s admiration for Holmes\u2019s intellect and his growing concern that Holmes may be emotionally detached.", "B": "It suggests that Watson is becoming increasingly frustrated with Holmes\u2019s ability to read people and his lack of emotional connection.", "C": "It illustrates Watson\u2019s belief that Holmes\u2019s methods are a form of manipulation rather than intellectual curiosity.", "D": "It reflects Watson\u2019s growing realization that Holmes\u2019s intellect is both a strength and a barrier to his understanding of others.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Watson\u2019s admiration for Holmes\u2019s intellect, but also his growing concern that Holmes may be too emotionally detached due to his sharp observations and analytical mind.Choice B is incorrect because Watson is not frustrated, but rather intrigued and concerned by Holmes\u2019s ability to read people.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Watson sees Holmes\u2019s methods as manipulation, but more as a powerful, unsettling form of intellect.Choice D is incorrect because while Watson sees Holmes\u2019s intellect as a strength, the passage does not focus on a realization about it being a barrier, but rather a concern that Holmes lacks emotional depth.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
