Nick Carraway reflects on Gatsby's mysterious life.", "text": "Nick had been intrigued by Gatsby ever since he first met him. <u>Gatsby\u2019s extravagant parties and mysterious background only seemed to deepen Nick\u2019s curiosity. Yet, there was something about Gatsby\u2019s unshakable optimism that made him both admirable and tragic. Despite his wealth and success, it was clear that Gatsby was still searching for something elusive, something he could never truly attain.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes that Gatsby's success is ultimately meaningless because he has not found happiness.", "B": "It suggests that Nick is becoming frustrated with Gatsby's unrealistic goals and is beginning to lose interest in him.", "C": "It highlights the complexity of Gatsby\u2019s character, showing his optimistic nature despite the emptiness in his life.", "D": "It reflects Nick's belief that Gatsby\u2019s wealth and status have isolated him from the things that really matter in life.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion focuses on Gatsby\u2019s optimism, despite the emptiness and unattainable desires in his life, showing the complexity of his character.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Nick\u2019s frustration or loss of interest in Gatsby but rather on his growing curiosity and understanding of him.Choice C is incorrect. While Gatsby\u2019s wealth may not bring him true happiness, the passage emphasizes his optimistic pursuit, not the meaninglessness of his success.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Gatsby\u2019s isolation due to his wealth, but rather on his unshakable optimism and longing.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
