{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Lockwood, the narrator, reflects on his visit to Wuthering Heights and his brief meeting with Catherine Earnshaw.", "text": "Lockwood had been struck by Catherine's appearance when he first saw her. She was a wild-looking woman, her eyes full of fire and defiance. <u>But as she spoke, her words were full of bitterness and a strange kind of longing, as though she were torn between love and hate, between the past and the present.</u> It was a feeling that seemed to hang over her, a restlessness he couldn\u2019t quite understand.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows Catherine\u2019s internal conflict between her emotions for someone from her past and her current situation.", "B": "It emphasizes Catherine\u2019s inability to move on from her past relationships.", "C": "It illustrates Catherine\u2019s desire for revenge and the negative impact of her bitterness.", "D": "It reflects Lockwood\u2019s growing curiosity about Catherine\u2019s troubled nature.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Catherine\u2019s internal conflict, torn between love and hate, past and present, indicating her emotional turmoil.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus solely on Catherine\u2019s inability to move on but on her conflicting emotions in general.Choice C is incorrect because while Catherine\u2019s words are bitter, the passage does not emphasize revenge or the purely negative impact of her emotions.Choice D is incorrect because, although Lockwood is curious, the focus is more on Catherine\u2019s internal struggle rather than his growing curiosity.Let me know if you need any more examples or adjustments!"}
