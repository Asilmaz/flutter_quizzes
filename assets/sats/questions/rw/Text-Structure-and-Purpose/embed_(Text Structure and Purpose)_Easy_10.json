{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850). Hester Prynne is reflecting on her life and the scarlet letter she wears as punishment for her sin.", "text": "Hester Prynne stood before the crowd, her head held high, despite the weight of her shame. The scarlet letter on her chest seemed to burn with an intensity of its own, yet she felt no shame in wearing it. <u>Over the years, the letter had become a part of her, as much a symbol of her strength as it was of her sin.</u> It was a mark that defined her, but it did not defeat her.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows how Hester\u2019s feelings about the scarlet letter have evolved over time.", "B": "It highlights Hester\u2019s ongoing shame over her past actions.", "C": "It illustrates how the scarlet letter has become a source of Hester\u2019s inner conflict.", "D": "It reflects Hester\u2019s desire to separate herself from her past.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes how the scarlet letter has transformed from a symbol of shame to one of strength for Hester over time. She now views it as a part of herself, indicating a shift in her perspective.Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion does not focus on Hester\u2019s shame. Rather, it highlights her growing sense of strength in the face of her punishment.Choice C is incorrect. While the scarlet letter does symbolize both sin and strength, the passage does not suggest that Hester is experiencing inner conflict about the letter.Choice D is incorrect. The passage emphasizes Hester\u2019s acceptance of the letter, rather than her desire to separate herself from her past.Let me know if you'd like more questions like this!"}
