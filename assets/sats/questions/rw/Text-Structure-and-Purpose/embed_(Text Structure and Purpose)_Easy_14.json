{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger (1951). Holden Caulfield, the narrator, is describing his experience at the Museum of Natural History.", "text": "I like the museum, but I didn\u2019t feel like going in that day. I was just walking around the outside, kind of kicking at the snow, when I thought about how much I hated growing up. <u>Everything I ever really liked was either dead or gone, and I couldn\u2019t figure out why things had to change like that.</u> It was depressing, but I felt like I had to keep moving.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Holden\u2019s fear of change and the passage of time.", "B": "It reveals Holden\u2019s nostalgia for his childhood and simpler times.", "C": "It suggests Holden's frustration with the adult world and its complexities.", "D": "It highlights Holden's indifference to the things he used to enjoy.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion reflects Holden\u2019s fear of change and his sense of loss. He struggles to understand why things change, which emphasizes his discomfort with growing up and the passage of time.Choice B is incorrect because while Holden is reflecting on things he liked, the passage does not specifically emphasize nostalgia for childhood, but more his frustration with change.Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence does not directly focus on Holden\u2019s frustration with the adult world, but rather his difficulty accepting change.Choice D is incorrect because Holden\u2019s emotional reaction is more about the difficulty of change, not indifference to what he once enjoyed.Let me know if you\u2019d like more exercises or adjustments!"}
