{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on the impact of his portrait and his own self-image.", "text": "Dorian Gray had always been captivated by his own beauty, but it was only after seeing his portrait that he truly understood its significance. <u>As he gazed at the image, he felt an overwhelming sense of vanity, as though his appearance had become the most important thing in his life. He began to realize that the portrait, hidden away from the world, would bear the consequences of his actions\u2014while he remained untouched by the passage of time and his own sins.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing obsession with his appearance and his belief that beauty is his most valuable trait.", "B": "It suggests that Dorian is beginning to feel guilty about his actions and the impact they are having on his portrait.", "C": "It illustrates Dorian\u2019s increasing fear of aging and the consequences of his lifestyle.", "D": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s realization that he can separate his external appearance from the consequences of his behavior.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because the underlined portion reveals Dorian's realization that he can maintain his youthful appearance while his portrait, which represents his inner self, bears the consequences of his actions. This marks a significant moment in his understanding of the separation between his external beauty and internal corruption.Choice A is incorrect because while Dorian is obsessed with his appearance, the passage does not suggest that beauty is his most valuable trait, but that he can avoid the consequences of his actions.Choice B is incorrect. While Dorian is aware of the consequences of his actions, the passage does not focus on guilt, but rather on the discovery that his portrait will reflect those consequences.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not focus on fear of aging, but on the separation between his external and internal selves.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
