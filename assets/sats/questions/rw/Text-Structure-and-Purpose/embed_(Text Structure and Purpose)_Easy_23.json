{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818). Victor Frankenstein reflects on his creation and the consequences of his actions.", "text": "Victor paced back and forth in his lab, his mind filled with the consequences of his actions. <u>He had thought he was creating life, but he had only brought forth misery and despair. The creature\u2019s very existence seemed to mock him, to remind him of the dangers of playing God.</u> He could no longer deny that his ambition had led him down a dark and destructive path.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates how Victor feels that his creation is an affront to his scientific achievements.", "B": "It emphasizes Victor\u2019s growing realization that his creation has brought about negative consequences.", "C": "It suggests that Victor regrets his actions and wishes to undo the creation.", "D": "It highlights Victor's belief that the creature\u2019s existence is a reflection of his own inner turmoil.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion underscores Victor's growing awareness that his creation has not resulted in success, but in misery and despair. This realization reinforces the negative consequences of his ambition.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Victor feeling affronted by his creation in terms of his scientific work, but rather on the despair it has caused.Choice C is incorrect. While Victor regrets his creation, the passage does not suggest he is actively seeking to undo his actions, but rather reflects on the path he has taken.Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion does not address Victor\u2019s inner turmoil; it focuses more on the creature\u2019s consequences in his life.Let me know if you\u2019d like further examples or adjustments!"}
