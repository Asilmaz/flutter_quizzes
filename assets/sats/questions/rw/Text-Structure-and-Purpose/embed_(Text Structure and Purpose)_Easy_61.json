{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett (1911). Mary Lennox reflects on her time spent in the garden.", "text": "Mary had spent many afternoons in the secret garden, and each day it seemed to become more familiar to her. <u>At first, it had felt like a place of solitude, a refuge from the world. But now, she began to see it as a place where she could grow and change, just like the flowers and plants she tended to. The garden no longer felt like an escape, but a place of transformation.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Mary\u2019s growing sense of control over her surroundings and her ability to influence them.", "B": "It suggests that Mary still sees the garden primarily as a place to avoid her problems.", "C": "It illustrates how the garden has become a symbol of Mary\u2019s connection to nature and the outdoors.", "D": "It emphasizes Mary\u2019s realization that the garden represents personal growth and change for her.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows how the garden has become a symbol of growth and transformation for Mary, highlighting her personal change as she spends more time there.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Mary views the garden as an escape, but as a place of transformation and growth.Choice C is incorrect. While Mary connects with the garden, the passage emphasizes the personal growth and change she experiences there, not just her connection to nature.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus on Mary\u2019s control over her surroundings, but on how the garden becomes a space for her growth.Let me know if you need any more examples or adjustments!"}
