{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Call of the Wild by Jack London (1903). Buck, the dog, reflects on his time in the wilderness.", "text": "Buck had always been a domesticated dog, but as he spent more time in the wild, he began to change. <u>The call of the wild grew stronger with each passing day, urging him to embrace his instincts and leave behind the comforts of civilization. Though Buck had known the warmth of a home and the safety of a master\u2019s care, the wilderness now felt like his true home. His primal instincts awakened, and he found himself more and more willing to fight for survival, abandoning any lingering attachment to his former life.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Buck\u2019s desire to leave behind civilization and fully embrace the violence and savagery of the wild.", "B": "It suggests that Buck is beginning to feel trapped by the wilderness and is longing for the safety of his former life.", "C": "It reflects Buck\u2019s belief that survival in the wilderness requires complete independence from others.", "D": "It highlights Buck\u2019s growing connection to the wilderness, showing how he is becoming more attuned to his primal instincts.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Buck\u2019s increasing connection to the wilderness and his growing willingness to embrace his primal instincts, showing his shift toward survival and independence.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Buck feels trapped by the wilderness, but rather that he is becoming more drawn to it.Choice C is incorrect because while Buck\u2019s instincts are awakening, the passage does not suggest that he believes survival requires total independence, but rather a deeper connection to the wild.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize Buck\u2019s desire for violence and savagery, but rather a return to his natural, instinctual state.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
