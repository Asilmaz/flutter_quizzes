{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien (1937). Bilbo Baggins is reflecting on his unexpected journey and the adventures he\u2019s faced.", "text": "Bilbo had never imagined that his quiet life in the Shire would lead him to face trolls, goblins, and dragons. <u>Yet with every step, he found himself braver than he had ever thought possible. He had learned to use his wits and his courage to survive, and with each victory, he grew more confident in his abilities.</u> Bilbo couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how far he had come since leaving his comfortable home.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Bilbo\u2019s growing realization that he is more capable than he had ever imagined.", "B": "It suggests that Bilbo is starting to lose his fear and hesitation about future dangers.", "C": "It shows that Bilbo is proud of his bravery but still feels uncertain about his future.", "D": "It highlights how Bilbo\u2019s growing confidence in his abilities is a result of his challenges.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Bilbo\u2019s increasing bravery and confidence, which result directly from the challenges he\u2019s faced and the victories he\u2019s achieved.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Bilbo is losing his fear, but rather that he is becoming more confident in his abilities as a result of facing challenges.Choice C is incorrect. While Bilbo is confident, the passage does not focus on uncertainty about the future but rather on his growth through his experiences.Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion emphasizes Bilbo\u2019s growing confidence, not his realization of his own capabilities.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
