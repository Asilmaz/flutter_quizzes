{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Call of the Wild by Jack London (1903). Buck, a dog who has been forced to adapt to the wild, reflects on his newfound freedom.", "text": "Buck had been in the wild for some time now, and though his body was growing stronger with each passing day, there was something else that had changed. <u>He had come to understand that the wild was not just a place, but a way of life\u2014one that demanded strength, courage, and the will to survive.</u> His instincts had sharpened, and for the first time, Buck truly felt at home.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Buck\u2019s struggle to balance his domesticated past with his wild instincts.", "B": "It shows that Buck has rejected his past and embraced his new life.", "C": "It highlights Buck\u2019s realization that he must become like the other animals in the wild.", "D": "It emphasizes Buck\u2019s growing adaptation to the wild and its demands.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes that Buck has come to understand the wild as a lifestyle, not just a physical environment, marking his full adaptation to the challenges it presents.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not describe Buck rejecting his past but rather adapting to his new reality.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Buck trying to become like other animals, but on his understanding of the wild\u2019s demands.Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the passage of Buck struggling to balance his past with his instincts; instead, it highlights his embrace of the wild way of life.Let me know if you need more questions or adjustments!"}
