{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger (1951). Holden Caulfield reflects on his experiences at Pencey Prep and his feelings of isolation.", "text": "Holden had never fit in at Pencey Prep. He often found himself observing others, feeling like an outsider. <u>He resented the way everyone seemed so obsessed with fitting in, with following the rules, as if being like everyone else was the most important thing in the world. Holden could not understand why people didn\u2019t just let themselves be who they truly were.</u> He couldn\u2019t escape the feeling that he was different, but it only made him feel more isolated.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Holden\u2019s frustration with societal expectations and his desire to stand apart from them.", "B": "It shows that Holden feels superior to others because he rejects the idea of conformity.", "C": "It suggests that Holden is beginning to understand the importance of fitting in with others.", "D": "It reflects Holden\u2019s belief that people who conform are weak and unoriginal.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion illustrates Holden\u2019s frustration with the pressures to conform and his desire for people to embrace their individuality rather than following societal expectations.Choice B is incorrect because while Holden is frustrated by conformity, the passage does not suggest that he feels superior to others. It focuses more on his confusion and frustration.Choice C is incorrect. The passage does not show Holden beginning to understand the importance of fitting in. Rather, it emphasizes his rejection of conformity.Choice D is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that Holden views those who conform as weak, but rather that he simply doesn\u2019t understand the desire to fit in.Let me know if you need any further examples or adjustments!"}
