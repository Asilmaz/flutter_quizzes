{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894). Mowgli, the boy raised by wolves, is learning the ways of the jungle.", "text": "Mowgli had learned many things from the wolves and other creatures of the jungle. He knew how to move silently through the underbrush, how to find food, and how to protect himself from danger. <u>But it was the law of the jungle that Mowgli had come to understand the most\u2014every creature had its place, and the strong must rule over the weak.</u> The law had become a guiding principle for him, one that helped him navigate the wild world around him.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes the importance of the law of the jungle in Mowgli's survival.", "B": "It suggests that Mowgli feels conflicted about the law of the jungle and its demands.", "C": "It reflects Mowgli's desire to challenge the law of the jungle and make his own rules.", "D": "It shows Mowgli\u2019s growing understanding of the natural hierarchy in the jungle.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights how Mowgli has come to understand the jungle\u2019s law as an essential principle that governs the creatures\u2019 interactions. This understanding helps him navigate his world.Choice A is incorrect because while the law of the jungle is important for survival, the passage doesn\u2019t focus solely on survival, but on Mowgli\u2019s understanding of it.Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn\u2019t suggest Mowgli\u2019s desire to challenge the law; it focuses on his acceptance of it as a guiding principle.Choice D is incorrect. There\u2019s no indication of Mowgli feeling conflicted about the law; instead, it shows his understanding and acceptance of it.Let me know if you need any further changes or more examples!"}
