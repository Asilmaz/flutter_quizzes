{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (1960). Scout Finch reflects on her father, Atticus Finch, and the challenges he faces.", "text": "Scout had always admired her father, Atticus, but as she grew older, she began to see just how difficult his life was. <u>Atticus was calm, patient, and just, but the world around him was full of prejudice and hatred. Despite the challenges he faced, he never allowed his beliefs to be swayed by others. His unwavering sense of justice became more apparent to Scout as she witnessed his actions during the trial.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Scout\u2019s growing recognition of Atticus\u2019s moral strength and commitment to justice.", "B": "It suggests that Scout is beginning to feel frustrated with her father\u2019s unyielding beliefs.", "C": "It emphasizes how Atticus\u2019s sense of justice has been shaped by his experiences in a prejudiced world.", "D": "It shows that Scout is learning to appreciate the difficulties of being a lawyer in a divided society.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows how Scout is beginning to understand and admire her father\u2019s moral strength and commitment to justice, particularly as she observes his actions during the trial.Choice B is incorrect. While Scout is recognizing Atticus\u2019s integrity, the passage does not suggest that she feels frustrated by his beliefs, but rather that she appreciates them.Choice C is incorrect because the passage focuses more on Atticus's moral strength, not how his sense of justice is shaped by prejudice.Choice D is incorrect because the focus is on Atticus\u2019s unwavering sense of justice, not the challenges of being a lawyer in a divided society.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
