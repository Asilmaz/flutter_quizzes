{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on the impact of his portrait and his obsession with beauty.", "text": "Dorian had always been captivated by his own beauty, but when he first saw his portrait, he felt an unsettling sense of detachment. <u>The portrait seemed to age in his place, showing the marks of his indulgent and reckless lifestyle while Dorian himself remained youthful and flawless. As the years passed, Dorian became more and more obsessed with the idea that his appearance would always remain perfect, while his soul\u2014hidden in the portrait\u2014would bear the consequences of his actions.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing obsession with his appearance and his belief that he can avoid the consequences of his actions.", "B": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s realization that his external beauty and internal corruption are inseparably linked.", "C": "It illustrates Dorian\u2019s fear that the portrait will one day reveal the true nature of his soul to the world.", "D": "It suggests that Dorian is beginning to feel the weight of his sins and is starting to regret his lifestyle.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing obsession with his physical appearance and his belief that he can escape the consequences of his behavior, which are shown in the portrait.Choice B is incorrect because while Dorian does become more aware of the portrait's transformation, the passage focuses more on his obsession with maintaining his appearance, not the inseparable link between his soul and his beauty.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize Dorian's fear of the portrait revealing his soul; instead, it shows his growing obsession with his own image and the portrait's reflection of his sins.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest regret; Dorian is more fixated on his appearance and how the portrait will carry the consequences of his actions.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
