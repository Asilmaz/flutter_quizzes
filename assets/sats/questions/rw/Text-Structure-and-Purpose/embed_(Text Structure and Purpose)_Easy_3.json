	"introduction": "The following text is adapted from a Victorian novelist’s unpublished manuscript describing a strict boarding school.",
	"text": "At sunrise, a bell tolled to rouse the pupils from sleep, and by sunset, a different bell commanded them indoors for mandatory study. This perpetual sequence of metallic summons governed their every action, granting no interval for spontaneity. It was as though each ring stripped them of a morsel of their very will.",
	"question": "Which choice best describes the function of the last sentence in the text as a whole?",
	"A": "It clarifies how the bell system improved students’ discipline.",
	"B": "It reveals the emotional impact of the bell system on the students’ sense of freedom.",
	"C": "It celebrates the school’s innovative method for maintaining order.",
	"D": "It questions whether the bells were truly necessary for daily scheduling.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The final sentence uses vivid language to show how the relentless bells undermine the students’ autonomy, emphasizing the emotional toll of the regimented routine."
