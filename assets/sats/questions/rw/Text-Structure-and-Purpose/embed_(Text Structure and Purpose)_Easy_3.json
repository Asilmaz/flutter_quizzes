{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Call of the Wild by Jack London (1903). Buck, a dog, is adjusting to life in the wild after being taken from his comfortable home.", "text": "Buck did not know whether he was going to be beaten or rewarded. He knew only that his body was stiff from the journey, his paws sore, and his spirit beginning to break under the harsh conditions. <u>But in his heart, there was a fire that could not be extinguished, a fire that kept him moving forward even when he felt he might collapse.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It explains why Buck is physically exhausted despite his determination.", "B": "It reflects Buck\u2019s confusion about the dangers of his new life.", "C": "It highlights Buck\u2019s unwavering resilience in difficult circumstances.", "D": "It suggests that Buck is slowly giving up hope for survival.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Buck\u2019s inner strength and resilience.

The underlined portion speaks to Buck\u2019s fire and determination, not a loss of hope.Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or more examples!"}
