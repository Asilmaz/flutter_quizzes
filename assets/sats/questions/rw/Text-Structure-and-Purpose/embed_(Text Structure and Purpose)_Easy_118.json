{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818). Victor Frankenstein reflects on the consequences of his scientific experiment.", "text": "Victor had spent years in isolation, obsessed with creating life. <u>When he finally succeeded, he was horrified by what he had done. The creature\u2019s appearance was monstrous, and Victor\u2019s heart sank when he realized that he had created something that was both alive and deeply unnatural. He immediately regretted his actions, but the creature, now alive, seemed to be aware of its creator\u2019s fear and disgust, which only deepened Victor's sense of guilt and responsibility.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Victor is beginning to doubt his scientific abilities and wonders whether his experiment was a failure.", "B": "It emphasizes Victor\u2019s immediate horror and guilt upon realizing the consequences of his scientific ambition.", "C": "It illustrates Victor\u2019s belief that the creature\u2019s monstrous appearance is the sole cause of his regret and fear.", "D": "It highlights Victor\u2019s growing sense of helplessness and fear of being unable to control the creature he has brought to life.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion focuses on Victor\u2019s immediate reaction of horror and regret after realizing the consequences of his actions, which is central to his sense of guilt.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Victor doubts his scientific abilities; rather, he regrets the result of his ambition.Choice C is incorrect because while the creature's appearance is mentioned, the passage emphasizes Victor\u2019s emotional reaction and regret, not just the appearance.Choice D is incorrect because while Victor is fearful, the passage highlights his regret and guilt more than his helplessness or fear of losing control.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
