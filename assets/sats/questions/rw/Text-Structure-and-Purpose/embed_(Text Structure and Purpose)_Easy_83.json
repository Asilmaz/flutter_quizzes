{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck (1937). George reflects on his relationship with Lennie.", "text": "George had known Lennie for a long time, and he often found himself acting as a protector. <u>Though Lennie was gentle and kind-hearted, his lack of control often led to trouble. George had to be the one to guide him, to keep him out of danger, but sometimes he wondered if Lennie understood how much he depended on him. George often wished he could take a break from being Lennie\u2019s caretaker, but deep down, he knew he couldn\u2019t abandon him.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects George\u2019s fear that Lennie\u2019s innocence will eventually lead to serious consequences for both of them.", "B": "It suggests that George resents Lennie\u2019s dependence on him and is growing increasingly frustrated with his role.", "C": "It illustrates George\u2019s belief that Lennie should be able to care for himself, but he feels obligated to help.", "D": "It emphasizes George\u2019s internal conflict between feeling responsible for Lennie and wanting freedom from the burden of care.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion reveals George\u2019s internal struggle. He feels responsible for Lennie but also wishes for a break from this responsibility, highlighting his conflicting emotions of care and frustration.Choice B is incorrect because while George may feel burdened at times, the passage does not indicate resentment or frustration to the degree suggested by this choice.Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t suggest that George believes Lennie should be able to care for himself, but rather that George takes on the role of protector out of necessity.Choice D is incorrect because while George may worry about the consequences of Lennie\u2019s actions, the passage does not focus on fear but on George\u2019s emotional conflict regarding his role as a caretaker.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
