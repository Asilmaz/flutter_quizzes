{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck (1937). George Milton reflects on his relationship with his companion, Lennie Small.", "text": "George had always been the caretaker of Lennie, even when the other men on the ranch mocked or criticized him. <u>But George could never shake the feeling that Lennie\u2019s innocence and trust were a kind of burden, something that made their dreams of a better life seem harder to achieve. Though he loved Lennie like a brother, George sometimes wondered how much longer he could carry the weight of protecting him in a world so unforgiving.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes George\u2019s deep affection for Lennie and his sense of duty to protect him, despite the challenges it brings.", "B": "It suggests that George feels resentful of Lennie\u2019s dependence on him and is beginning to feel trapped by it.", "C": "It illustrates George\u2019s growing frustration with Lennie\u2019s inability to understand the consequences of his actions.", "D": "It reflects George\u2019s fear that Lennie\u2019s innocence will lead to their failure in achieving their dreams.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows that George feels a sense of responsibility and affection for Lennie, but also acknowledges that Lennie's innocence and trust make achieving their dreams more difficult.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not indicate resentment, but rather a deep internal conflict about the burden of responsibility.Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus on frustration with Lennie\u2019s understanding of consequences, but more on the emotional weight George carries.Choice D is incorrect because while George fears failure, the passage focuses more on the burden of protection, not on Lennie\u2019s innocence directly causing their failure.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
