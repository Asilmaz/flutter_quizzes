{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (1960). Scout Finch reflects on her father, Atticus Finch, and his role in the town.", "text": "Scout had always admired her father, Atticus, but as she grew older, she began to see the weight of the work he did. <u>Atticus wasn\u2019t just a lawyer; he was a man of deep conviction and moral integrity. The townspeople often criticized him for defending Tom Robinson, but Atticus never let their judgment sway him. He believed in the importance of doing what was right, even when it wasn\u2019t popular or easy.</u> Scout realized that this quiet strength was one of the things she respected most about him.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Scout\u2019s growing admiration for her father\u2019s ability to handle public criticism with dignity.", "B": "It suggests that Atticus\u2019s commitment to justice often isolates him from the community and his family.", "C": "It illustrates that Atticus\u2019s moral strength is what drives him to challenge societal norms, despite the cost.", "D": "It emphasizes Atticus\u2019s unwavering commitment to justice and his ability to stand firm despite public criticism.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Atticus\u2019s unwavering belief in doing what is right, regardless of the public opinion, showing his strength of character and dedication to justice.Choice B is incorrect because while Atticus faces criticism, the passage does not focus on isolation but rather on his commitment to justice in the face of opposition.Choice C is incorrect. While Atticus\u2019s moral strength is mentioned, the passage does not specifically emphasize his challenge of societal norms, but rather his consistent pursuit of justice.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Scout\u2019s admiration for how Atticus handles criticism, but on his moral integrity and determination to do what is right.Let me know if you'd like more examples or adjustments!"}
