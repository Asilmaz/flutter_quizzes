{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck (1939). Tom Joad reflects on the struggles his family faces during the Great Depression.", "text": "Tom walked alongside the dusty road, the weight of his family\u2019s losses heavy on his shoulders. <u>The land that had once been their home now belonged to the bank. They had lost everything, yet Tom could not shake the sense of determination that had taken root in him. He knew that they could not give up, no matter how difficult the journey ahead might be. The strength of his family, their unity, was what would keep them moving forward.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Tom\u2019s sense of responsibility toward his family and his determination to keep them together.", "B": "It suggests that Tom is beginning to lose hope for his family\u2019s future and is unsure of their ability to survive.", "C": "It highlights Tom\u2019s realization that their survival depends not just on physical strength, but on emotional unity.", "D": "It reflects Tom\u2019s growing frustration with the hardships they face and his desire to escape them.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Tom\u2019s determination to keep his family moving forward despite their losses, highlighting his sense of responsibility and his belief in the power of family unity.Choice B is incorrect because the passage shows Tom's determination, not his loss of hope or uncertainty about their survival.Choice C is incorrect because while emotional unity is important, the passage emphasizes Tom\u2019s determination and responsibility, rather than a realization about the nature of survival.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not indicate Tom\u2019s frustration or desire to escape, but rather his resolve to press forward.Let me know if you need any more examples or adjustments!"}
