{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain (1884). Huck reflects on his evolving feelings toward Jim, the runaway slave.", "text": "Huck had known Jim for a while now, and the more time they spent together, the more Huck began to think of him as a friend. <u>Jim had always been kind to Huck, offering him comfort and advice. The more Huck saw of Jim\u2019s loyalty and goodness, the more Huck began to feel a deep sense of responsibility toward him. Huck knew that helping Jim escape was the right thing to do, but he also understood that it would cost him dearly.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Huck is beginning to feel burdened by Jim\u2019s dependence on him and is unsure whether to help him.", "B": "It highlights Huck\u2019s growing sense of duty toward Jim, showing how their friendship has evolved into something deeper.", "C": "It illustrates Huck\u2019s realization that helping Jim will not be easy and may have serious consequences.", "D": "It reflects Huck\u2019s belief that Jim\u2019s loyalty is the primary reason he must help him, rather than any sense of moral responsibility.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Huck\u2019s evolving perception of Jim, emphasizing how their relationship has grown from simple companionship to a deeper friendship that involves a sense of responsibility.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t focus on Huck feeling burdened by Jim's dependence, but rather on Huck recognizing his responsibility and growing attachment to Jim.Choice C is incorrect because while Huck is aware of the consequences, the passage focuses more on the emotional bond between him and Jim rather than just the consequences of helping.Choice D is incorrect because Huck\u2019s decision to help Jim is driven by a growing moral sense of responsibility, not just Jim's loyalty.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
