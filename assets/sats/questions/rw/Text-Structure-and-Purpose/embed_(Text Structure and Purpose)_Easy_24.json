{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway reflects on the extravagant lifestyle he observes at Gatsby\u2019s mansion.", "text": "Nick watched from the distance as the party continued in full swing at Gatsby\u2019s mansion. The music was loud, and the guests were carefree, reveling in the lavishness of the night. <u>But there was an underlying emptiness to it all, a sense that the wealth and glamour could not hide the loneliness that many of the guests seemed to carry with them.</u> Nick couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that, for all the extravagance, something was missing.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows that Nick feels disconnected from the people at the party, despite their wealth.", "B": "It suggests that Nick is beginning to question the validity of the lifestyle Gatsby promotes.", "C": "It emphasizes the contrast between the outward appearance of wealth and the inner emptiness of the characters.", "D": "It highlights the temporary nature of the joy and excitement at Gatsby's parties.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights the emptiness beneath the wealth and glamour of the party. Nick perceives that the extravagance of the event cannot conceal the loneliness of the guests.Choice B is incorrect because while Nick does feel something is missing, the passage does not indicate he is questioning Gatsby's lifestyle directly.Choice C is incorrect. Though Nick feels something is missing, the passage does not focus on his personal disconnection but rather on the guests\u2019 emptiness.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t suggest the joy is temporary, but rather emphasizes the deeper emptiness amidst the celebration.Let me know if you\u2019d like further adjustments or more questions!"}
