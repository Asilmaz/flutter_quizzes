{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on his life as he examines his portrait.", "text": "Dorian stood before the portrait, unable to tear his eyes away. He had seen the changes in his face over the years, but the portrait remained as youthful and beautiful as ever. <u>It was as though the painting held all of his sins and the consequences of his actions, while he himself remained untouched by time or guilt.</u> Dorian couldn\u2019t help but wonder how long this strange arrangement could last.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing awareness that his sins are having a physical effect on him.", "B": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s increasing desire to live a more virtuous life in order to avoid consequences.", "C": "It highlights Dorian\u2019s belief that the portrait is a separate entity, outside of his control.", "D": "It suggests that Dorian feels trapped by the portrait and its reflection of his moral corruption.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the underlined portion illustrates how the portrait is connected to Dorian\u2019s actions and moral decay. The portrait serves as a reflection of the consequences Dorian avoids, which makes him feel trapped by it.Choice A is incorrect. While Dorian is aware of the changes in the portrait, the passage does not directly suggest that his sins are physically affecting him yet.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Dorian seeing the portrait as a separate entity, but rather as a reflection of his inner corruption.Choice D is incorrect because Dorian's thoughts do not indicate any desire to change his lifestyle, but rather his fascination with how long the current arrangement can last.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
