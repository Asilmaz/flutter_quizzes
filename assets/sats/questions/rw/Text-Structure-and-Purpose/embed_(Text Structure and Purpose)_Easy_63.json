{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850). Hester Prynne reflects on her time in prison and the scarlet letter she must wear as punishment.", "text": "Hester Prynne stood in front of the crowd, her head held high despite the shame she felt. The scarlet letter on her chest burned like fire. <u>But over time, the letter became a part of her identity, a symbol not just of her sin, but of her strength and resilience. What had once been a mark of shame was now something she could no longer separate from herself. It no longer shamed her, but reminded her of the life she had led and the person she had become.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes how Hester has come to accept her punishment and see it as an integral part of her identity.", "B": "It shows that Hester continues to feel ashamed of her past, despite her outward display of strength.", "C": "It suggests that Hester is beginning to regret her actions and wishes to remove the letter from her chest.", "D": "It reflects Hester\u2019s desire to challenge the symbolic nature of the scarlet letter and its effect on her life.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows how Hester has shifted from shame to acceptance, and the scarlet letter has become a symbol of her strength and resilience, now inseparable from her identity.Choice B is incorrect because the passage suggests that Hester no longer feels ashamed of the letter, but has come to accept it as a part of her identity.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Hester regrets her actions or wants to remove the letter, but rather that she has found strength in it.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest a desire to challenge the letter, but rather a process of acceptance and transformation.Let me know if you need any further examples or adjustments!"}
