{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850). Hester Prynne is reflecting on her life and the scarlet letter she wears as punishment for her sin.", "text": "Hester stood before the crowd, her head held high despite the shame she felt. The scarlet letter on her chest seemed to burn with its own fire. <u>Yet as time passed, she began to realize that the letter had become a part of her, a symbol not just of her sin, but of her strength. It no longer shamed her, but served as a constant reminder of the life she had led and the person she had become.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Hester\u2019s emotional growth as she accepts the scarlet letter and what it represents.", "B": "It suggests that Hester is still burdened by the shame of her actions despite her outward confidence.", "C": "It emphasizes the societal judgment that Hester continues to face because of her sin.", "D": "It reflects Hester\u2019s desire to reject the scarlet letter and the shame it symbolizes.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion reveals Hester\u2019s shift in perspective, as she moves from shame to acceptance of the scarlet letter as a symbol of her strength and resilience.Choice B is incorrect because while Hester once felt shame, the passage shows that she has overcome that feeling and now sees the letter as a symbol of her personal strength.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not focus on society\u2019s judgment of Hester, but rather on her internal growth and acceptance.Choice D is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Hester's acceptance of the scarlet letter, not her rejection of it.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
