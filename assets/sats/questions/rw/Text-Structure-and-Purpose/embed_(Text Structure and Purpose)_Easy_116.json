{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on his changing feelings about his portrait.", "text": "Dorian Gray had admired his portrait from the moment it was painted, and over the years, he had come to depend on it as a symbol of his youth and beauty. <u>As time went on, the portrait began to show signs of wear, capturing every sin he committed, while Dorian himself remained unscathed. He became increasingly obsessed with the portrait, wondering how long he could preserve his outward perfection. The more he looked at the painting, the more he felt as if it were a reflection of his soul, revealing the darkness he wished to conceal.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing sense of guilt, suggesting that his perfection is a fa\u00e7ade that hides his inner corruption.", "B": "It highlights Dorian\u2019s belief that the portrait is a direct reflection of his true character, showing how his sins are written on his soul.", "C": "It illustrates Dorian\u2019s fear that his outward appearance will eventually deteriorate and reveal the consequences of his actions.", "D": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s increasing fascination with the portrait as a symbol of his immortality and eternal youth.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows that Dorian\u2019s obsession with the portrait stems from his growing awareness that it reveals the darkness of his soul, which contrasts with his outward perfection.Choice B is incorrect because although Dorian feels the portrait reflects his soul, the passage emphasizes his guilt over his inner corruption rather than a direct connection between the portrait and his character.Choice C is incorrect because the focus is on the portrait\u2019s representation of Dorian\u2019s inner corruption, not his fear about his appearance deteriorating.Choice D is incorrect because Dorian is not fascinated by the portrait as a symbol of immortality but as a way to conceal the consequences of his actions.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
