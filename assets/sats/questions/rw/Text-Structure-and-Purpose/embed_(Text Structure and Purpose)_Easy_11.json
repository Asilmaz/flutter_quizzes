	"introduction": "The following text is adapted from a 1784 lecture given by a natural philosopher contemplating the migration patterns of birds.",
	"text": "Each autumn, our feathered friends depart these shores with unerring punctuality, yet few can explain precisely how they chart their routes. Ancient lore states they follow the path of celestial bodies, but I suspect they harbor an innate sense that transcends mere starlight navigation.",
	"question": "Which choice best characterizes the text’s main idea?",
	"A": "It advocates for the abandonment of classical explanations in favor of proven methods.",
	"B": "It explains that bird migration is fully understood through scientific experimentation.",
	"C": "It contrasts traditional beliefs about bird migration with the lecturer’s speculation that other, less tangible mechanisms may guide them.",
	"D": "It argues that no real distinction exists between celestial navigation and innate behavior in animals.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct. The passage first mentions the ancient belief in celestial guidance, then poses the speaker’s alternative view that birds have an inborn sense. This juxtaposition underscores the main theme."
