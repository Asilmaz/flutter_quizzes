{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck (1937). George and Lennie, two migrant workers, are on their way to a new job.", "text": "Lennie\u2019s hands were trembling as he tried to get the cans of beans open. He was hungry and frustrated, and the pressure of the situation seemed to make everything harder. <u>George was patient, watching him with a quiet intensity, understanding that Lennie\u2019s simple heart and strong hands were not enough to overcome his struggles in a world that didn\u2019t always make sense.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes how George tries to protect Lennie from the difficulties of their life.", "B": "It reveals George\u2019s frustration with Lennie\u2019s inability to perform simple tasks.", "C": "It suggests that George feels pity for Lennie\u2019s lack of understanding of the world.", "D": "It shows how George feels responsible for Lennie\u2019s actions and struggles.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights George\u2019s understanding and quiet intensity as he watches Lennie struggle. This suggests that George feels responsible for Lennie\u2019s well-being and is attuned to his struggles, as he knows Lennie\u2019s abilities are limited in a world that doesn\u2019t cater to him.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not indicate frustration, but rather shows George's understanding and patience.Choice C is incorrect. While George is protective, the passage does not focus on pity but on understanding Lennie\u2019s limitations and the challenges he faces.Choice D is incorrect. The passage does not emphasize George\u2019s protection of Lennie in this moment, but his quiet awareness of Lennie\u2019s struggle.Let me know if you need more questions or further adjustments!"}
