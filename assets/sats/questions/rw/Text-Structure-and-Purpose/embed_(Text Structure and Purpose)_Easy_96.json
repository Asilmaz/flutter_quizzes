{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger (1951). Holden Caulfield reflects on his feelings about growing up.", "text": "Holden had always been critical of the adult world, but as he wandered through New York, he began to feel a sense of disillusionment. <u>He had spent so much of his life resisting the pressure to conform, but now, more than ever, he felt lost between childhood and adulthood. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that neither world seemed to offer him anything worthwhile. Holden longed for the simplicity and innocence of childhood, but he also knew he couldn\u2019t stay there forever.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows that Holden is becoming more comfortable with adulthood and is beginning to embrace the changes it brings.", "B": "It emphasizes Holden\u2019s internal struggle as he grapples with the transition from childhood to adulthood.", "C": "It suggests that Holden feels trapped between two worlds, unable to find peace in either childhood or adulthood.", "D": "It reflects Holden\u2019s belief that adulthood is meaningless and that he should completely reject it in favor of remaining a child.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion illustrates Holden's internal conflict as he feels torn between the innocence of childhood and the responsibilities of adulthood, unsure of where he belongs.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Holden is becoming comfortable with adulthood but rather feels disillusioned by both childhood and adulthood.Choice C is incorrect because while Holden does feel lost, the passage emphasizes his struggle with the transition, not a sense of being trapped between the two worlds.Choice D is incorrect because Holden\u2019s feelings do not lead to a complete rejection of adulthood, but rather a longing for childhood\u2019s simplicity, even as he recognizes he cannot remain there forever.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
