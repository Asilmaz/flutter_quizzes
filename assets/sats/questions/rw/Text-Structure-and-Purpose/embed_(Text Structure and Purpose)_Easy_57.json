{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894). Mowgli, the boy raised by wolves, reflects on his understanding of the jungle.", "text": "Mowgli had learned much from the wolves and other animals, but he knew that his survival depended on something more than just knowledge. <u>The law of the jungle was simple, yet brutal. It taught him that only the strong could survive, and that strength didn\u2019t always come from power, but from wisdom and knowing when to act. Mowgli understood that his place in the jungle wasn\u2019t just given, it was earned.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes the importance of wisdom and strategic thinking in the jungle\u2019s harsh environment.", "B": "It suggests that Mowgli is beginning to doubt the law of the jungle and its fairness.", "C": "It highlights Mowgli\u2019s growing awareness that his survival requires physical strength above all else.", "D": "It reflects Mowgli\u2019s belief that he has earned his place in the jungle by his own actions.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion explains that strength in the jungle comes not only from power but from wisdom and understanding when to act, underscoring the importance of intelligence in survival.Choice B is incorrect because there is no indication that Mowgli doubts the law of the jungle, only that he understands it deeply.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize physical strength over wisdom, but rather that survival comes from a balance of both strength and intelligence.Choice D is incorrect because while Mowgli does understand the law of the jungle, the passage does not focus on him \u201cearning\u201d his place in it but rather on how he applies wisdom and strategy to survive.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
