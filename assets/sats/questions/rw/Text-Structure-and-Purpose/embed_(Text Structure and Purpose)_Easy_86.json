{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851). Ishmael reflects on Captain Ahab\u2019s obsession with the white whale.", "text": "Ishmael had been traveling with Captain Ahab for some time, and he had come to understand that Ahab's obsession with the white whale was more than just a quest for revenge. <u>Ahab spoke of the whale as though it were a force of nature, an enemy that had wronged him personally. His obsession was consuming him, yet there was an intensity in his words that drew others in, as though Ahab believed that this pursuit defined his very purpose in life.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Ahab is using his obsession with the whale to inspire his crew and create a sense of purpose.", "B": "It emphasizes the way Ahab\u2019s obsession with the whale is both a personal vendetta and a greater existential struggle.", "C": "It illustrates that Ahab's obsession is growing uncontrollable and is leading him to act irrationally.", "D": "It reflects Ishmael's growing admiration for Ahab\u2019s intense passion and sense of purpose.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights how Ahab sees the white whale as both a personal enemy and a symbol of a greater struggle, showing the complexity of his obsession.Choice B is incorrect because while Ahab may inspire his crew, the passage does not emphasize that he is intentionally using his obsession to motivate them, but rather that it consumes him personally.Choice C is incorrect. Although Ahab's obsession is intense, the passage does not focus on it as uncontrollable or irrational, but rather as a meaningful pursuit.Choice D is incorrect because Ishmael\u2019s view of Ahab\u2019s obsession is more about understanding and curiosity, not admiration of his passion.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
