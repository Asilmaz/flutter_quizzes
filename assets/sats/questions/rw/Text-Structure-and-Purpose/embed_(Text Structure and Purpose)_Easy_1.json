{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist, is reflecting on her feelings toward Mr. Darcy after their initial encounters.", "text": "Elizabeth had not been long in the room before she felt that the conversation was not in her favor. She was being quietly scrutinized, though no one said anything that might make her uncomfortable. She wished to retreat, but she also felt oddly compelled to stay. She glanced at Mr. Darcy, who seemed deep in thought, his gaze avoiding hers. There was a coolness in the air that matched her own feelings toward him. <u>She wondered whether he had any real interest in her.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Elizabeth is unsure about Mr. Darcy's feelings toward her.", "B": "It reveals Elizabeth's increasing admiration for Mr. Darcy.", "C": "It emphasizes Elizabeth's growing desire to distance herself from Mr. Darcy.", "D": "It illustrates the tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, highlighting her discomfort.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it directly reflects Elizabeth's uncertainty regarding Mr. Darcy\u2019s feelings. The underlined sentence shows her wondering whether Mr. Darcy has any genuine interest in her, signaling her doubts and lack of clarity about his intentions.Choice B is incorrect. There\u2019s no evidence in the passage of Elizabeth admiring Mr. Darcy; rather, she is unsure of his feelings toward her.Choice C is not correct because the underlined sentence does not mention Elizabeth\u2019s desire to distance herself. It focuses on her contemplation of Mr. Darcy\u2019s feelings.Choice D is incorrect because while the passage has an air of tension, the underlined portion does not emphasize discomfort so much as Elizabeth's questioning of Mr. Darcy's interest.Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or additional exercises!"}
