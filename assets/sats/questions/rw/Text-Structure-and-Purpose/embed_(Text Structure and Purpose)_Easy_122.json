{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850). Hester Prynne reflects on the meaning of the scarlet letter.", "text": "Hester Prynne had worn the scarlet letter for many years, and it had become a symbol of both her shame and her strength. <u>Over time, she had come to see the letter not only as a mark of her sin, but as a symbol of her resilience. People began to see her differently, and she no longer felt the sting of their judgment as she once did. The letter, once a source of humiliation, had transformed into a representation of her ability to endure and rise above her punishment.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Hester is beginning to feel ashamed of the letter and wants to rid herself of its burden.", "B": "It emphasizes Hester\u2019s growing sense of empowerment as she embraces the letter as a symbol of her personal strength and endurance.", "C": "It reflects Hester\u2019s belief that the letter symbolizes both her personal failure and her path to redemption.", "D": "It illustrates Hester\u2019s desire to use the letter as a form of rebellion against societal expectations and judgment.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Hester\u2019s growing sense of empowerment, as she comes to see the scarlet letter as a symbol of her strength and ability to endure, rather than just a mark of shame.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Hester feels ashamed of the letter, but rather that she has transformed her perspective on it over time.Choice C is incorrect because while the letter does represent both sin and endurance, the passage emphasizes Hester\u2019s transformation into a symbol of strength, rather than focusing on redemption.Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Hester views the letter as a form of rebellion; instead, it symbolizes her personal strength in the face of punishment.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
