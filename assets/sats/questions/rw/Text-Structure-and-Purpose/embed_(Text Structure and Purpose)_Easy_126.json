{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818). Victor Frankenstein reflects on the consequences of his scientific experiment.", "text": "Victor Frankenstein had spent years in isolation, working tirelessly to create life. <u>When he finally succeeded and saw the creature open its eyes, he was filled with horror and regret. The monster\u2019s appearance was nothing like what he had envisioned\u2014it was grotesque, and Victor was overwhelmed by a sense of guilt and fear. He had brought a life into the world, but instead of the triumph he had imagined, he faced an unintended consequence that left him shaken and disgusted.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Victor\u2019s disbelief at his failure, as he realizes that his experiment has not turned out as he had hoped.", "B": "It emphasizes Victor\u2019s immediate reaction of horror and regret, showing the unexpected and tragic consequences of his ambition.", "C": "It suggests that Victor\u2019s guilt stems from a realization that he should have never attempted to create life in the first place.", "D": "It highlights Victor\u2019s fear of the creature\u2019s potential danger and his desire to distance himself from his creation.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion describes Victor\u2019s immediate feelings of horror and regret upon seeing the creature, emphasizing the unintended and tragic consequences of his ambition.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Victor\u2019s disbelief at failure, but on his horror and guilt at the creature\u2019s appearance and his regret.Choice C is incorrect because although Victor feels guilt, the passage focuses on his immediate reaction to the creature\u2019s appearance, not on a broad realization that he should not have created life.Choice D is incorrect because while Victor is afraid of the creature, the passage does not focus solely on his fear of danger, but on his regret and horror at what he has created.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
