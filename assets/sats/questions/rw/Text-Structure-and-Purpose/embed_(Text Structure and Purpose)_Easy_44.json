{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain (1876). Tom reflects on his attempt to avoid work and the consequences of his actions.", "text": "Tom sat under the tree, enjoying the cool shade and thinking of ways to avoid his chores. <u>He knew that Aunt Polly would be furious if she found out he had been daydreaming instead of working, but the thought of painting that fence filled him with dread.</u> He began to wonder if there might be a way to make the work seem more interesting, something that would keep him entertained while still getting the job done.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Tom\u2019s reluctance to take responsibility for his chores and the pressure he feels from Aunt Polly.", "B": "It shows Tom\u2019s guilt over avoiding his chores and the consequences he fears.", "C": "It illustrates Tom\u2019s growing desire to find a creative solution to avoid work and escape punishment.", "D": "It highlights Tom\u2019s understanding that work is a necessary part of life, despite his resistance to it.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Tom\u2019s initial dread of his chore, but it also reveals his creative thinking about how to make the task seem more interesting, which suggests his desire to avoid work while still completing it.Choice A is incorrect. While Tom is reluctant to work, the passage does not emphasize the pressure from Aunt Polly, but his own desire to avoid the task.Choice C is incorrect. Although Tom dreads the chore, the passage doesn\u2019t focus on guilt, but rather on how he plans to make the task more engaging.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t reflect Tom\u2019s understanding of work as necessary but instead shows his desire to avoid it in a more creative way.Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional examples!"}
