{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on his changing views of life and his obsession with beauty.", "text": "Dorian Gray had always been admired for his youthful appearance, but as he grew older, he became increasingly fixated on his portrait. <u>The portrait, hidden away in a room, began to show the signs of Dorian\u2019s indulgent and immoral behavior, while Dorian himself remained flawless. His obsession with maintaining his beauty and youth grew, and he found himself wondering how long he could keep up the charade, fearing that the portrait would eventually reveal all the darkness he had concealed.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Dorian is starting to lose his sense of self and is becoming consumed by his obsession with beauty.", "B": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing satisfaction with the power he feels in controlling his image and avoiding consequences.", "C": "It highlights Dorian\u2019s fear that his outward appearance will no longer match the hidden corruption in his soul.", "D": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s belief that the portrait will ultimately show his true character, no matter how hard he tries to hide it.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Dorian's fear that his outward appearance (which remains youthful) will eventually be at odds with the corruption revealed in his portrait, highlighting the tension between his external beauty and inner decay.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Dorian\u2019s satisfaction, but on his fear that the portrait will reveal the consequences of his actions.Choice C is incorrect because while Dorian is obsessed with beauty, the passage does not suggest that he is losing his sense of self, but rather that he is worried about the portrait revealing his dark secrets.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not reflect a belief that the portrait will inevitably show his true character; it focuses on his fear that it will reveal the darkness he\u2019s trying to hide.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
