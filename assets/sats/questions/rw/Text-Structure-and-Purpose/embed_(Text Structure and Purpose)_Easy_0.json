{
	"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman by Laurence Sterne (1759). In this passage, the narrator reflects on the peculiarities of his upbringing and family conversations.",
	"text": "It was my uncle’s steadfast belief that every word uttered over a child’s cradle must shape that child’s eventual character. Accordingly, each visitor was subtly instructed to speak only of heroism or virtue in my presence, lest my young mind learn any base notion. Yet, the very care with which these salutary tales were recounted imparted to me a sense of mischief that was perhaps the precise opposite of their intent.",
	"question": "Which choice best describes the main purpose of the text?",
	"A": "To praise the narrator’s uncle for his emphasis on moral education",
	"B": "To depict a method of childrearing that inadvertently fosters unwanted traits",
	"C": "To explain why the narrator rarely had visitors during his infancy",
	"D": "To argue that children are unlikely to imitate the behavior they observe",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The text highlights how the uncle’s determined effort to promote noble qualities paradoxically gives the narrator a mischievous streak. The passage presents a scenario in which a well-intentioned upbringing backfires."
