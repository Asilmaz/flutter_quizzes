{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle (1892). Sherlock Holmes is describing his methods to Watson after solving a difficult case.", "text": "You see, Watson, said Holmes, it is not always the most obvious details that lead to the solution of a case. In fact, it is often the seemingly insignificant observations that reveal the most. <u>For example, had I not noticed the peculiar stain on the rug in the drawing-room, I would have missed the entire motive behind the crime.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Holmes often relies on physical evidence to solve cases.", "B": "It shows how Holmes used the rug stain to confirm his initial theory about the crime.", "C": "It illustrates how Holmes made a key discovery that changed his approach to the case.", "D": "It emphasizes the importance of small, overlooked details in solving mysteries.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights the significance of seemingly trivial details, like the rug stain, which ultimately played a pivotal role in solving the case.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not mention Holmes confirming an initial theory; instead, it emphasizes how the rug stain led to a crucial insight about the crime.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not describe a shift in Holmes's approach, only the importance of the rug stain.Choice D is incorrect because the focus is on observation and detail, rather than physical evidence like the rug stain itself.Let me know if you'd like more examples!"}
