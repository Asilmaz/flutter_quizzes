{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet reflects on her changing opinion of Mr. Darcy.", "text": "Elizabeth had always found Mr. Darcy's pride to be irritating, yet as she learned more about him, her feelings began to shift. <u>She could see that, despite his aloofness, Darcy had a deep sense of duty to his family and friends. His actions, though often misunderstood, were motivated by a strong moral code.</u> Elizabeth could no longer dismiss him as simply arrogant, though she still wrestled with the pride he exhibited.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Elizabeth is still unsure whether Mr. Darcy\u2019s actions are genuinely noble.", "B": "It highlights Elizabeth\u2019s growing admiration for Mr. Darcy\u2019s sense of duty and morality.", "C": "It illustrates how Elizabeth\u2019s opinion of Mr. Darcy is still clouded by her previous judgments.", "D": "It reflects Elizabeth\u2019s belief that Mr. Darcy\u2019s pride is ultimately a flaw in his character.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Elizabeth\u2019s growing recognition that Mr. Darcy\u2019s pride is tempered by a strong sense of duty and morality, causing her opinion of him to shift.Choice B is incorrect because while Elizabeth recognizes Darcy\u2019s sense of duty, she is no longer uncertain about his motivations. The passage shows her changing opinion.Choice C is incorrect. The passage suggests that Elizabeth\u2019s opinion is changing, not that it is still clouded by previous judgments.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Elizabeth\u2019s belief that Darcy\u2019s pride is a flaw, but rather on how she starts to see deeper qualities in him.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
