Huck couldn\u2019t help but wonder how Jim had come to be so selfless and trusting.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Huck\u2019s belief that Jim\u2019s kindness is motivated by a sense of obligation rather than genuine affection.", "B": "It suggests that Huck is beginning to feel burdened by Jim\u2019s dependence on him and is unsure about their relationship.", "C": "It highlights Huck\u2019s growing recognition of Jim\u2019s loyalty and the depth of their friendship.", "D": "It reflects Huck\u2019s growing frustration with the difficulties of their journey and his desire to distance himself from Jim.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion focuses on Huck\u2019s growing understanding of Jim\u2019s loyalty and kindness, which deepens their friendship and makes Jim more than just a traveling companion.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Huck feels burdened by Jim\u2019s dependence. Instead, Huck appreciates Jim\u2019s companionship and protection.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Huck sees Jim\u2019s kindness as driven by obligation, but rather as a sign of true friendship.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not reflect Huck\u2019s frustration with the journey or a desire to distance himself from Jim, but rather an appreciation of their growing bond.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
