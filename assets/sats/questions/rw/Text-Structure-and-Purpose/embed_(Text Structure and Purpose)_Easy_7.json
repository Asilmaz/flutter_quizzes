Scout Finch, the narrator, reflects on her father, Atticus, and his role in their town.", "text": "Atticus was never too busy to listen to me, no matter what was going on in his life. He made me feel like what I said mattered, even when it was just a small thing. <u>He always treated people with respect, no matter who they were, and that made me proud to be his daughter.</u> I learned from him that standing up for what is right is more important than standing with the crowd.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes how Scout's admiration for her father grew over time.", "B": "It shows how Atticus\u2019s respect for others influenced Scout\u2019s view of the world.", "C": "It suggests that Atticus\u2019s actions are more important to Scout than his words.", "D": "It highlights how Scout\u2019s relationship with her father helped her develop a moral compass.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes the impact Atticus's respect for others had on Scout, shaping her views and feelings about him. This respect made her proud of him, and it reflects the core lesson she learned from him.Choice A is incorrect. The passage does not focus on how Scout\u2019s admiration for Atticus grew over time, but rather on how his actions shaped her perception of respect.Choice C is incorrect. While Atticus\u2019s actions are mentioned, the underlined sentence emphasizes his respectful treatment of others, not a comparison between actions and words.Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn't specifically focus on how their relationship directly influenced Scout's moral development. Instead, it highlights the respect Atticus showed to others.Let me know if you'd like to generate more questions!"}
