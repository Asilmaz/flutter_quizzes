{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Lockwood reflects on his growing curiosity about Heathcliff.", "text": "Lockwood had only recently met Heathcliff, but he found himself thinking about the man constantly. <u>Heathcliff's silence was unsettling, yet there was an undeniable strength in his presence. Despite the harshness of his exterior, Lockwood could sense that there was more to him than the bitterness he showed the world. Heathcliff was a man deeply connected to the land, to the place that had shaped him.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Lockwood\u2019s growing admiration for Heathcliff\u2019s resilience and strength despite his bitterness.", "B": "It emphasizes the complexity of Heathcliff\u2019s character, suggesting that his bitterness hides a deeper connection to his surroundings.", "C": "It suggests that Lockwood is starting to feel sympathy for Heathcliff\u2019s painful past and his emotional wounds.", "D": "It reflects Lockwood\u2019s confusion about why Heathcliff remains so distant and withdrawn despite his strong presence.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes the contrast between Heathcliff's harsh exterior and the deeper connection he has with the land, suggesting that his bitterness may conceal more complex feelings or experiences.Choice B is incorrect because while Lockwood notices Heathcliff\u2019s strength, the passage does not indicate admiration for resilience, but rather hints at a deeper, more complex connection with the land.Choice C is incorrect because while there may be a sense of intrigue, the passage does not suggest that Lockwood feels sympathy for Heathcliff\u2019s past, but rather is struck by the complexity of his character.Choice D is incorrect. The passage does not focus on Lockwood\u2019s confusion about Heathcliff\u2019s withdrawal but on his sense that there is more to Heathcliff than meets the eye.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
