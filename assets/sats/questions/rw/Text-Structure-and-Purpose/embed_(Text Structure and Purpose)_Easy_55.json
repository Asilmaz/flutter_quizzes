{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851). Ishmael reflects on Captain Ahab\u2019s obsession with the white whale.", "text": "Ishmael had seen many strange things on the journey, but nothing compared to the intense fixation Ahab had on the white whale. <u>Ahab spoke of the whale as though it were an embodiment of all his suffering, all his anger, and all his desire for revenge. It was clear to Ishmael that Ahab\u2019s pursuit was no longer about the whale itself, but about conquering something that had become a symbol of all the wrongs Ahab had suffered in life.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Ishmael's growing concern that Ahab's pursuit of the whale is leading him toward destruction.", "B": "It suggests that Ahab is becoming increasingly obsessed with the idea of revenge, losing sight of his original purpose.", "C": "It emphasizes Ahab's shift from viewing the whale as an animal to seeing it as a symbol of his personal struggles.", "D": "It reflects Ahab\u2019s belief that the whale is the source of all his suffering and that defeating it will bring him peace.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion describes how Ahab's focus shifts from the physical whale to a deeper, symbolic pursuit of revenge and personal suffering, showing a change in his mindset.Choice B is incorrect because while Ahab is obsessed, the passage does not specifically suggest that he has lost sight of his original purpose but rather that his obsession has evolved into something more symbolic.Choice C is incorrect. While Ishmael may be concerned about Ahab's obsession, the passage focuses on Ahab\u2019s own shift in perception, not on Ishmael's growing concern.Choice D is incorrect because while Ahab may believe the whale symbolizes his suffering, the passage emphasizes his obsession with conquering the whale as a symbol rather than as a source of peace.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
