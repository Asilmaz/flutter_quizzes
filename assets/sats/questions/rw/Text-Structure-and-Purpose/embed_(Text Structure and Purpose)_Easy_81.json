Buck, the dog, reflects on his new life in the wild.", "text": "Buck had always been a domesticated dog, but the wilderness changed him. <u>In the wild, survival was a constant battle. But as Buck fought to adapt, he began to feel a powerful surge of energy and strength coursing through him. He no longer relied on human kindness but on his own instincts. Every struggle, every challenge made him more attuned to the wild rhythms of nature. The wilderness was not just a place\u2014it was a part of him now.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It reflects Buck\u2019s sense of fear and struggle as he tries to survive in the wild.", "B": "It suggests that Buck is starting to lose his memories of his life with humans and is becoming more animalistic.", "C": "It highlights Buck\u2019s growing connection to the wild and the internal transformation that comes with it.", "D": "It emphasizes that Buck still longs for the comfort of human companionship despite his survival instincts.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Buck\u2019s transformation from a domesticated dog to a creature deeply connected to the wild, with instincts guiding his survival and growth.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Buck is forgetting his life with humans but is instead adapting and thriving in the wild.Choice C is incorrect because while Buck faces struggles, the passage focuses more on his adaptation and strength rather than fear.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not reflect a longing for human companionship, but rather Buck\u2019s growing independence and connection to nature.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
