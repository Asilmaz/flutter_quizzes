{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813). Elizabeth Bennet is reflecting on her growing feelings for Mr. Darcy.", "text": "Elizabeth could not deny that Mr. Darcy had many qualities that impressed her. He was handsome, wealthy, and intelligent. <u>But it was not these things that had begun to affect her most deeply. It was his kindness, the way he treated his sister, and the humility he showed in difficult situations.</u> These qualities made her see him in a new light, and despite herself, she found her feelings for him beginning to change.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes the qualities that Elizabeth initially found unappealing about Mr. Darcy.", "B": "It illustrates Elizabeth\u2019s ongoing doubts about Mr. Darcy's true nature.", "C": "It shows how Elizabeth is beginning to appreciate Mr. Darcy\u2019s character and personal virtues.", "D": "It reflects Elizabeth\u2019s belief that Mr. Darcy\u2019s wealth is the most important aspect of his character.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights how Elizabeth\u2019s feelings for Mr. Darcy are changing due to her recognition of his personal virtues, such as kindness, humility, and the way he treats his sister.Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not focus on qualities Elizabeth finds unappealing, but rather on how her perspective of Darcy is changing for the better.Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion does not indicate any ongoing doubts but instead reveals Elizabeth\u2019s growing appreciation for Darcy\u2019s character.Choice D is incorrect because the passage emphasizes qualities like kindness and humility, not Darcy\u2019s wealth.Let me know if you\u2019d like more questions or adjustments!"}
