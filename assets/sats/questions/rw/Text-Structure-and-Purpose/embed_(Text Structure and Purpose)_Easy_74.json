{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on the effects of his lifestyle.", "text": "Dorian Gray had always been aware of his striking beauty, but as the years passed, he noticed that his appearance remained unchanged, while others around him aged. <u>He had lived a life of indulgence and excess, yet his portrait, hidden away in a room, bore the marks of his actions. Every sin, every indulgence seemed to be etched into the painting, while Dorian himself remained youthful and flawless. The more he saw the portrait change, the more he began to feel the weight of his own choices.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights the growing tension between Dorian\u2019s outward appearance and the consequences of his actions, as represented by the portrait.", "B": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s increasing satisfaction with his ability to avoid the effects of aging and consequence.", "C": "It suggests that Dorian feels no guilt or remorse for his actions and is detached from the impact of his lifestyle.", "D": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s belief that the portrait represents the truth of his identity, while he remains untouched by reality.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion underscores the contrast between Dorian\u2019s unchanged physical appearance and the visible consequences of his actions in the portrait, suggesting the emotional and moral tension he feels as a result.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest satisfaction in Dorian; instead, it indicates his growing awareness of the consequences represented by the portrait.Choice C is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that Dorian feels detached from his consequences, but rather that he is beginning to feel the weight of his choices as he notices the changes in the portrait.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Dorian believes the portrait represents his true identity, but that it bears the consequences of his actions, which he is becoming more aware of.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
