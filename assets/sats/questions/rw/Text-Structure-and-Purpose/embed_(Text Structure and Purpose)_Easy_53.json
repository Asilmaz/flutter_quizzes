{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on his changing appearance and the consequences of his actions.", "text": "Dorian stood before his portrait, gazing at the image of his youthful face. The portrait seemed to capture all his beauty, but there was something else in it too. <u>As Dorian lived a life of excess and indulgence, the portrait began to change, showing the marks of his sins and vices. But Dorian himself remained untouched, his outward appearance as perfect as ever, a stark contrast to the corruption within.</u> He couldn\u2019t help but wonder how long this arrangement could last.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights the contrast between Dorian\u2019s outward beauty and the corruption that festers within him.", "B": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s belief that his physical appearance will never change, despite his actions.", "C": "It suggests that Dorian is becoming more aware of the consequences of his indulgent lifestyle.", "D": "It illustrates Dorian\u2019s growing desire to destroy the portrait and escape the consequences of his actions.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes the stark contrast between Dorian's unchanged appearance and the corruption in the portrait, highlighting the duality of his character.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not focus on Dorian\u2019s belief that his physical appearance will never change, but rather on the growing discrepancy between his outward and inner selves.Choice C is incorrect. While the passage hints at Dorian\u2019s internal conflict, it does not specifically suggest that he is becoming more aware of the consequences of his lifestyle.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not indicate Dorian\u2019s desire to destroy the portrait but focuses on the contrast between his exterior and the portrait\u2019s reflection of his inner corruption.Let me know if you need any more examples or adjustments!"}
