{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818). Victor Frankenstein reflects on the monster he created.", "text": "Victor had always been consumed by his desire to push the boundaries of science. <u>When he first saw the monster, Victor was horrified by what he had brought to life. The creature\u2019s size and appearance were monstrous, yet there was a glimmer of life in its eyes. Victor recoiled in disgust, feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt and responsibility for creating something so unnatural. He realized, too late, that his ambition had led him to a path of destruction.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Victor\u2019s immediate emotional response to the monster and his sense of responsibility for its existence.", "B": "It suggests that Victor is beginning to feel pity for the monster and regrets his actions in creating it.", "C": "It reflects Victor\u2019s belief that the monster is a reflection of his own inner darkness and guilt.", "D": "It emphasizes Victor\u2019s anger and frustration at the monster for defying his expectations and causing his downfall.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Victor\u2019s immediate reaction to the monster, which is horror and disgust, mixed with guilt and a realization of the responsibility he bears for creating it.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Victor feels pity for the monster, but rather guilt and responsibility for his creation.Choice C is incorrect. While Victor may experience guilt, the passage does not suggest that he sees the monster as a reflection of his inner self.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Victor\u2019s response is based on anger or frustration, but on horror and a sense of responsibility for his actions.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
