{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway reflects on his feelings toward Daisy Buchanan.", "text": "Nick had seen Daisy several times, and he was captivated by her beauty and charm. <u>Yet there was something about her that made Nick uneasy. Though she was outwardly gracious, her laughter seemed hollow, and her smile didn't reach her eyes. Nick began to sense that Daisy was not as happy or fulfilled as she appeared, as though something deeper was hidden beneath her perfect exterior. He wondered whether her charm was a mask for deeper dissatisfaction.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Nick\u2019s belief that Daisy is hiding something more significant than her dissatisfaction with life.", "B": "It suggests that Nick is beginning to distrust Daisy\u2019s outward charm and is questioning her sincerity.", "C": "It reflects Nick\u2019s admiration for Daisy's ability to appear graceful and perfect, despite her inner struggles.", "D": "It highlights Nick's growing sense that Daisy\u2019s outward appearance masks her inner discontent and dissatisfaction with her life.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion reveals Nick\u2019s growing sense that Daisy\u2019s outward charm and grace conceal a deeper dissatisfaction and unease.Choice B is incorrect because while Nick does sense that something is hidden, the passage doesn\u2019t suggest that he outright distrusts Daisy\u2019s charm.Choice C is incorrect because Nick is not admiring Daisy\u2019s ability to mask her struggles, but instead is becoming aware of the disconnection between her outward appearance and her inner feelings.Choice D is incorrect because while there is a sense that Daisy is hiding something, the passage emphasizes her inner dissatisfaction, not an unspecified, larger secret.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
