{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Lockwood reflects on his encounters with Catherine Earnshaw.", "text": "Lockwood had been spending more time at Wuthering Heights, trying to understand the strange dynamics of the household. <u>Catherine Earnshaw was a fiery and passionate woman, yet there was an underlying sadness in her that Lockwood couldn\u2019t ignore. Despite her sharp words and volatile nature, he began to sense a deep inner conflict. Lockwood wondered whether Catherine\u2019s bitterness was the result of past trauma, or if it was simply part of her complex character.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Lockwood is beginning to grow frustrated with Catherine\u2019s behavior and is unsure how to interpret her actions.", "B": "It emphasizes Lockwood\u2019s growing curiosity about Catherine\u2019s emotional depth and the reasons behind her bitterness.", "C": "It illustrates Lockwood\u2019s belief that Catherine\u2019s anger is the result of unresolved childhood issues that she has never addressed.", "D": "It reflects Lockwood\u2019s admiration for Catherine\u2019s ability to mask her emotions with anger and protect herself from others.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Lockwood\u2019s growing curiosity about Catherine\u2019s emotional complexity and the underlying reasons for her bitterness, suggesting he wants to understand her better.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest frustration, but rather intrigue and an attempt to understand Catherine\u2019s behavior.Choice C is incorrect. While Catherine\u2019s bitterness is noted, the passage does not directly suggest that it stems from childhood trauma but from a deeper emotional conflict.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not focus on admiration for Catherine\u2019s ability to mask her emotions but rather on Lockwood\u2019s curiosity about the causes of her bitterness.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
