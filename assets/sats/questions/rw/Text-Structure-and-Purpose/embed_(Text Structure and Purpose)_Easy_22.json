{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Little Women by Louisa May Alcott (1868). Jo March is writing to her mother about her desire to join a theater troupe.", "text": "Jo had always dreamed of performing, of stepping into the shoes of different characters, and letting her imagination run wild. <u>She knew, however, that her mother would not approve of such a career for a young woman.</u> But Jo felt a restless energy inside her, a longing for something more than the traditional role she was expected to play.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows Jo's growing independence from her mother\u2019s expectations.", "B": "It suggests that Jo is already beginning to doubt her desire to pursue acting.", "C": "It reflects Jo's frustration with the limitations placed on her as a woman.", "D": "It highlights Jo\u2019s awareness that her mother would not support her career choice.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows that Jo is fully aware her mother would disapprove of her decision to pursue acting. This awareness sets the tone for Jo\u2019s internal conflict throughout the passage.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Jo is doubting her desire to perform; it only shows her awareness of the potential disapproval.Choice C is incorrect. While Jo may feel some frustration, the passage does not focus on her feeling limited by her gender but on her awareness of her mother\u2019s potential reaction.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not emphasize Jo\u2019s desire for independence from her mother but rather her knowledge of her mother's likely disapproval.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
