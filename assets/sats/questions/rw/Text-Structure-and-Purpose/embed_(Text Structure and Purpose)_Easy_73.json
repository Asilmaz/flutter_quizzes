{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Lockwood reflects on his encounters with Catherine Earnshaw.", "text": "Lockwood had been spending more time at Wuthering Heights, trying to understand its mysterious inhabitants. <u>Catherine Earnshaw was an intriguing figure\u2014wild and untamed, yet there was a sadness in her eyes that Lockwood couldn\u2019t ignore. Despite her harshness, he sensed that her bitterness was rooted in something deeper, something that had shaped her over the years. Lockwood couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had caused her to become the way she was.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Catherine\u2019s bitterness is a result of her volatile personality and her inability to relate to others.", "B": "It emphasizes Catherine\u2019s complexity, suggesting that her outward harshness hides deeper emotional pain.", "C": "It reflects Lockwood\u2019s growing frustration with Catherine\u2019s behavior and his inability to understand her.", "D": "It illustrates Lockwood\u2019s belief that Catherine\u2019s behavior is entirely the result of her environment and upbringing.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights Lockwood\u2019s realization that Catherine\u2019s bitterness comes from deeper emotional pain, suggesting complexity in her character beyond her outward harshness.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Catherine\u2019s bitterness is due solely to her volatile personality but rather hints at a deeper emotional struggle.Choice C is incorrect because while Lockwood is curious about Catherine, the passage focuses more on his understanding of her complexity rather than frustration or confusion.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Catherine\u2019s behavior is solely shaped by her environment, but rather points to internal emotional factors.Let me know if you need further adjustments or examples!"}
