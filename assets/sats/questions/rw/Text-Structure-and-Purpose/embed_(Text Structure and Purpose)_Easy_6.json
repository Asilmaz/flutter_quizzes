The walls of this little room seem to grow smaller every day. <u>But in my heart, I know that the people in the house with me are my only family, my only hope.</u> Sometimes, I can hardly stand the waiting, but I remind myself that as long as we stay hidden, we can still live.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Anne\u2019s feelings of isolation and confinement.", "B": "It suggests that Anne is beginning to lose hope in the possibility of escape.", "C": "It highlights Anne\u2019s sense of attachment to the people she is hiding with.", "D": "It expresses Anne\u2019s anxiety about the waiting and uncertainty she faces.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because the underlined portion focuses on Anne\u2019s emotional attachment to the people she is hiding with.
