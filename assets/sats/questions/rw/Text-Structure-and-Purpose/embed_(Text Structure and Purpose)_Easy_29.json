{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Nelly Dean is telling Mr. Lockwood about the relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw.", "text": "Nelly paused for a moment, her voice quiet but intense as she recalled the past. Catherine, in her youth, had been a wild and impulsive spirit, while Heathcliff, despite his rough exterior, had a deep, almost unbearable love for her. <u>It was a love that couldn\u2019t be controlled by reason or by the world around them. Catherine knew that, but she couldn\u2019t decide whether it was worth the sacrifice.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes the impossibility of Heathcliff and Catherine\u2019s love.", "B": "It suggests that Catherine is afraid of the consequences of her love for Heathcliff.", "C": "It highlights Catherine\u2019s inner conflict about her feelings for Heathcliff.", "D": "It reflects Catherine\u2019s desire to control her emotions despite her love for Heathcliff.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion describes Catherine\u2019s uncertainty and inner conflict about whether her love for Heathcliff is worth the sacrifices it would entail, showing a struggle between emotion and reason.Choice B is incorrect because while Catherine is conflicted, the passage does not focus on fear of consequences but rather on the emotional dilemma of her love.Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that their love is impossible, but rather that Catherine is unsure about the sacrifices it requires.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Catherine is trying to control her emotions, but that she is questioning whether the love is worth the cost.Let me know if you need more questions or adjustments!"}
