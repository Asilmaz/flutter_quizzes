{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Call of the Wild by Jack London (1903). Buck, the protagonist, reflects on his new life in the wild.", "text": "Buck had always been domesticated, but the wilderness was a different world. <u>At first, the harsh conditions were terrifying, but gradually Buck\u2019s instincts took over. He felt the pull of the wild as though it had been calling him all along, and with each passing day, he became stronger, more attuned to the rhythms of nature. He was no longer just a pet\u2014he was part of the wild.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows that Buck is struggling to adapt to the wild and is fearful of the challenges it presents.", "B": "It emphasizes how Buck\u2019s transformation into a wild animal is driven by his instincts and connection to nature.", "C": "It illustrates Buck\u2019s growing resentment toward his past life as a domesticated pet.", "D": "It reflects Buck\u2019s realization that he no longer needs the company of humans to survive.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion highlights how Buck\u2019s instincts guide his transformation and how he begins to feel at home in the wild, a natural part of the environment.Choice B is incorrect because while the passage acknowledges the difficulty of the wild, it focuses more on Buck\u2019s adaptation and growth rather than fear.Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn\u2019t focus on resentment toward his past life but on Buck\u2019s growing connection to his natural instincts.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest Buck\u2019s realization of not needing humans; it focuses more on his transformation into a creature of the wild.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
