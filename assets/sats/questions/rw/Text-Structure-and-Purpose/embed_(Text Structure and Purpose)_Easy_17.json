{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck (1939). Tom Joad, the protagonist, is reflecting on the hardships his family has endured during the Great Depression.", "text": "Tom was tired, his body aching from the long hours of work. But what hurt more than his physical exhaustion was the knowledge that his family had lost their farm. <u>They were no longer landowners, no longer in control of their lives.</u> They were forced to travel, to seek work wherever they could find it, and Tom could feel the weight of that helplessness pressing on him.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Tom's determination to rebuild his family's future despite their losses.", "B": "It describes Tom's frustration with the changes in his family's lifestyle.", "C": "It illustrates the sense of helplessness that Tom feels after losing his family's farm.", "D": "It reflects Tom's fear that they will never recover from their misfortunes.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes the loss of control and the helplessness Tom feels after his family loses their farm. This aligns with the central theme of displacement in the novel.Choice B is incorrect because while Tom is frustrated, the passage does not focus on his frustration with the lifestyle change, but rather with the loss of control over their lives.Choice C is incorrect. While Tom is determined, the underlined portion does not emphasize his resolve to rebuild, but rather his sense of loss and helplessness.Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not specifically mention Tom\u2019s fear about the future; it focuses more on the immediate sense of helplessness from the loss.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more questions!"}
