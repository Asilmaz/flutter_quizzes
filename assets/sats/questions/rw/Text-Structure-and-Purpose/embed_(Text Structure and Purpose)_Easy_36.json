Scout Finch recalls her relationship with her father, Atticus Finch.", "text": "Scout had always admired her father, but as she grew older, she began to understand the depth of his wisdom and integrity. <u>Atticus was not just a lawyer\u2014he was a man of principle, someone who stood firm in his beliefs no matter the cost. His ability to remain calm and just, even in the face of hatred and prejudice, made Scout realize that there was more to him than she had ever imagined.</u> She felt proud of him, even when others criticized his actions.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It suggests that Scout feels conflicted about her father\u2019s actions and the opinions of others.", "B": "It emphasizes how Atticus\u2019s moral integrity inspires Scout\u2019s admiration and pride.", "C": "It highlights Atticus\u2019s struggle to balance his professional duties with his personal values.", "D": "It shows that Scout is becoming more aware of the challenges Atticus faces in his work.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes how Atticus's unwavering principles and his ability to remain calm in difficult situations inspire Scout's admiration and pride.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not show Scout feeling conflicted but rather proud of her father for his integrity.Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t mention Atticus\u2019s struggle between work and personal values; it focuses on his strength of character.Choice D is incorrect. Although Scout becomes aware of Atticus\u2019s qualities, the passage focuses more on how those qualities influence her admiration, not on her awareness of his challenges.Let me know if you need any more examples or adjustments!"}
