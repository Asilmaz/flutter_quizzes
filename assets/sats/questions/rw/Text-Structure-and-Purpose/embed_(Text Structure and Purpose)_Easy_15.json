{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851). Ishmael, the narrator, is reflecting on the nature of the sea.", "text": "The sea is an ancient thing, ever-changing and yet always the same. It\u2019s vast, beyond measure, and filled with secrets. <u>Some days, the ocean seems calm and still, like a mirror reflecting the sky. Other days, it\u2019s an angry beast, its waves crashing violently against the shore, as if in rage.</u> But no matter how it behaves, it\u2019s always there, relentless and constant.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It contrasts the sea's calmness with its capacity for violence.", "B": "It emphasizes the unpredictability of the ocean's behavior.", "C": "It illustrates how the sea affects Ishmael's mood and perspective.", "D": "It reflects Ishmael's belief that the sea is a metaphor for life itself.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion contrasts the sea's calmness with its violent nature, showing that the ocean can be both serene and destructive in its appearance.Choice B is incorrect. While the ocean's behavior is described as shifting, the passage doesn\u2019t focus on its unpredictability, but rather on its dual nature.Choice C is incorrect. The passage does not focus on Ishmael\u2019s mood; it discusses the sea's physical changes, not how it affects him personally.Choice D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that the sea is a metaphor for life, though it hints at the deeper meanings of its duality.Let me know if you need more examples or further adjustments!"}
