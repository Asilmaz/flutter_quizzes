{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890). Dorian Gray reflects on his relationship with his portrait.", "text": "Dorian Gray had always admired his portrait, but as the years passed, he began to feel a growing sense of unease whenever he looked at it. <u>The portrait, once a symbol of his beauty, now seemed to reflect the corruption within him. The more he indulged in his vices, the more the portrait seemed to decay, while Dorian himself remained youthful and untouched. He was terrified by the changes in the painting and the realization that it was a reflection of his soul, which he had been unwilling to confront.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Dorian\u2019s belief that his external appearance is becoming more perfect, even as his inner self deteriorates.", "B": "It suggests that Dorian is becoming fascinated by the portrait\u2019s transformation and views it as a symbol of his growing power.", "C": "It emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing horror and guilt as he realizes that his portrait is revealing the truth about his inner corruption.", "D": "It reflects Dorian\u2019s belief that the portrait is an accurate representation of his character and actions, which he must come to terms with.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes Dorian\u2019s growing horror and guilt, as the portrait increasingly reveals the consequences of his vices and inner corruption, which he is unwilling to confront.Choice B is incorrect because Dorian is not fascinated by the portrait\u2019s decay, but rather horrified by it, recognizing it as a symbol of his moral downfall.Choice C is incorrect because the passage focuses on the portrait\u2019s decay, not on Dorian\u2019s appearance becoming more perfect.Choice D is incorrect because the passage highlights Dorian\u2019s fear and avoidance of confronting the truth in the portrait, rather than accepting it as an accurate representation of his character.Let me know if you need further examples or adjustments!"}
