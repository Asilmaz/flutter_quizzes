{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway reflects on his interactions with Jay Gatsby.", "text": "Nick had been invited to Gatsby's extravagant party, where the lavishness seemed to be in stark contrast to the man himself. <u>Gatsby was polite, but there was something distant about him, as if he were watching his own life from the outside. His charm was undeniable, yet it felt as though his wealth and grandeur were simply a fa\u00e7ade, something he used to hide the emptiness within.</u> Nick found himself intrigued by Gatsby\u2019s mystery, yet unsettled by the sense of loneliness that seemed to follow him.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It emphasizes Gatsby\u2019s inability to enjoy the life he has created for himself despite his success.", "B": "It suggests that Gatsby\u2019s charm is insincere, and that he uses it to manipulate those around him.", "C": "It highlights Gatsby\u2019s use of wealth and charm to cover up his internal emptiness and loneliness.", "D": "It reflects Nick\u2019s growing belief that Gatsby\u2019s life is more fulfilling than it appears to others.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion emphasizes that Gatsby\u2019s outward wealth and charm are used to conceal a deeper sense of emptiness and loneliness, making it clear that his persona is a fa\u00e7ade.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Gatsby is manipulating anyone, but rather that he is distant and detached from his own life.Choice C is incorrect because while Gatsby's life is depicted as superficial, the passage doesn\u2019t explicitly state that he is unable to enjoy his success; rather, it highlights his emotional emptiness.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest that Nick believes Gatsby's life is more fulfilling, but rather that he is intrigued by the mystery and loneliness behind Gatsby\u2019s external appearance.Let me know if you need more examples or further adjustments!"}
