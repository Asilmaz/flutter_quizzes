{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925). Nick Carraway reflects on his relationship with Daisy Buchanan.", "text": "Nick had met Daisy several times, and he was fascinated by her beauty and charm. <u>But there was something about her that seemed distant, as though she were hiding behind a veil of superficiality. Despite her outward allure, Nick began to sense that there was a sadness behind her eyes, a kind of emptiness that no amount of wealth or social standing could fill. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Daisy was truly happy, or if she was simply playing a part in a world that expected her to.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It highlights Nick\u2019s growing awareness that Daisy\u2019s outward charm masks a deeper sadness and dissatisfaction with her life.", "B": "It suggests that Nick is beginning to distrust Daisy and her ability to maintain her charm in front of others.", "C": "It emphasizes Nick\u2019s belief that Daisy's life is perfect, but that she is hiding her true feelings from those around her.", "D": "It reflects Nick\u2019s admiration for Daisy\u2019s ability to keep her sadness hidden from everyone else.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion focuses on Nick's realization that Daisy\u2019s charm and beauty hide a deeper sadness and dissatisfaction, which makes her seem distant and unfulfilled.Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Nick is distrustful of Daisy; rather, it suggests he is intrigued and concerned about her hidden sadness.Choice C is incorrect because Nick doesn\u2019t believe Daisy\u2019s life is perfect, but rather sees the emptiness beneath her surface.Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn\u2019t reflect admiration for Daisy\u2019s ability to hide her sadness but focuses on Nick\u2019s growing understanding of it.Let me know if you need more examples or adjustments!"}
