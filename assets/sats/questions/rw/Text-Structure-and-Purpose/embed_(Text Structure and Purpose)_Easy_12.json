{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847). Catherine Earnshaw is reflecting on her complex relationship with Heathcliff.", "text": "Catherine gazed out of the window, her thoughts drifting back to the days when she and Heathcliff had been inseparable. <u>Even now, her heart stirred at the thought of him, though she knew that their love had been consumed by bitterness and pride.</u> The memories were both painful and cherished, like a fire that once burned bright but had long since turned to ashes.", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It illustrates Catherine's feelings of regret over her relationship with Heathcliff.", "B": "It highlights Catherine's ongoing emotional attachment to Heathcliff despite the past.", "C": "It shows how Catherine is trying to forget about Heathcliff and move on with her life.", "D": "It suggests that Catherine\u2019s memories of Heathcliff are fading and losing their importance.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Catherine\u2019s continuing emotional attachment to Heathcliff. Despite the bitterness and pride that have affected their relationship, her heart is still stirred by memories of him.Choice B is incorrect because although Catherine\u2019s memories are painful, the passage does not focus on regret but on the lingering emotional connection she feels.Choice C is incorrect. The passage indicates that Catherine still feels deeply for Heathcliff, rather than trying to forget him.Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion emphasizes Catherine\u2019s strong emotional response to Heathcliff, not the fading of her memories.Let me know if you'd like more questions or adjustments!"}
