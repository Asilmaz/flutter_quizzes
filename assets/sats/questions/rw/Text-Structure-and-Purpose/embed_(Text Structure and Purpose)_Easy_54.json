{"introduction": "The following text is adapted from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain (1884). Huck reflects on his experiences and the friends he has made along the way.", "text": "Huck had been on the river for days, with nothing but the sound of the water and the stars above him. <u>Though he had always valued his independence, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a deep connection to Jim, the runaway slave who had become his companion. Jim\u2019s kindness and loyalty had earned Huck\u2019s trust, and Huck was beginning to see him not just as a friend, but as someone who had become a true part of his life.</u>", "question": "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?", "A": "It shows that Huck is starting to feel responsible for Jim and his safety during their journey.", "B": "It suggests that Huck is beginning to question the idea of slavery and Jim\u2019s place in society.", "C": "It highlights Huck\u2019s growing emotional attachment to Jim, beyond their initial relationship as travel companions.", "D": "It reflects Huck\u2019s awareness that Jim is more than just a friend, but someone who needs his help.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the underlined portion shows Huck\u2019s growing emotional attachment to Jim, indicating that Huck now sees him as a true companion rather than just a fellow traveler.Choice B is incorrect. While Huck\u2019s relationship with Jim evolves, the passage does not specifically suggest Huck is questioning slavery but rather highlights the friendship and trust between them.Choice C is incorrect. While Huck may feel a sense of responsibility, the passage focuses more on Huck\u2019s emotional attachment to Jim, rather than his sense of duty to protect him.Choice D is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Huck\u2019s emotional connection to Jim, not his awareness of Jim needing help.Let me know if you need further adjustments or more examples!"}
