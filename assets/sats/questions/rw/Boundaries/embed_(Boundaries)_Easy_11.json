{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Dubliners</em>, James Joyce employs vivid imagery and careful punctuation to depict the reflective tone of his narrative. The following sentence builds on the descriptive style while testing the reader\u2019s understanding of proper punctuation use in integrating supplementary elements. The completion must align with the stylistic and grammatical conventions established in Joyce's writing.", "question": "<em>\"The snowflakes drifted quietly through the night air ______ each one a tiny, delicate reminder of winter\u2019s hold on the land.\"</em>", "A": "each one: a tiny, delicate reminder of winter\u2019s hold on the land.", "B": "each one, a tiny, delicate reminder of winter\u2019s hold on the land.", "C": "each one; a tiny, delicate reminder of winter\u2019s hold on the land.", "D": "each one\u2014a tiny, delicate reminder of winter\u2019s hold on the land.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Choice <strong>D</strong> is correct because the comma appropriately separates the supplementary appositive phrase each one a tiny, delicate reminder of winter\u2019s hold on the land from the rest of the sentence. This aligns with standard punctuation rules and preserves the reflective tone of the passage.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>A.</strong> The colon is inappropriate here because it suggests a complete thought precedes it, but each one is not an independent clause.<strong>B.</strong> The semicolon incorrectly separates the two parts of the sentence, which are not independent clauses.<strong>C.</strong> The dash disrupts the sentence\u2019s flow and introduces an overly dramatic pause that is inconsistent with Joyce\u2019s subtle narrative style."}
