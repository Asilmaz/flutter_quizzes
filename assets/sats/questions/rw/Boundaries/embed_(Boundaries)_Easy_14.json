This choice aligns with Steinbeck\u2019s style by creating a cohesive and fluid depiction of the scene.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>B.</strong> The prepositional phrase with the crisp leaves rustling incorrectly reduces the second part of the sentence to a subordinate idea, diminishing the balance of the description.<strong>C.</strong> The participial phrase the crisp leaves rustling leaves the sentence incomplete, failing to form a grammatically correct conclusion.<strong>D.</strong> The unnecessary comma before rustling gently in the breeze disrupts the sentence\u2019s rhythm and introduces a punctuation error."}
