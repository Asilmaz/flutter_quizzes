{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche explores themes of self-transcendence and the evolution of humanity. The following sentence reflects Nietzsche\u2019s philosophical tone and challenges your ability to apply proper punctuation and logical consistency to complete a complex idea.", "question": "<em>\"Nietzsche argues that humanity must transcend itself, striving for a higher existence ______\"</em>", "A": "and avoiding the temptation, to regress into comfort or stagnation.", "B": "and avoiding the temptation to regress; into comfort or stagnation.", "C": "and avoiding the temptation: to regress into comfort or stagnation.", "D": "and avoiding the temptation to regress into comfort or stagnation.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Choice <strong>A</strong> is correct because it uses proper conjunction and maintains a logical flow without unnecessary punctuation. The sentence reflects Nietzsche\u2019s style by emphasizing clarity and directness in discussing the need for transcendence.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>B.</strong> The comma after temptation is unnecessary and interrupts the sentence, creating a grammatical error by separating the verb from its complement.<strong>C.</strong> The semicolon after regress improperly breaks the sentence, disrupting the natural flow of the idea.<strong>D.</strong> The colon suggests an explanation or elaboration, which is inappropriate because the second clause is a continuation of the thought rather than a separate detail."}
