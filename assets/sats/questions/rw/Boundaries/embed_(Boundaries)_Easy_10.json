The following sentence explores similar philosophical concepts. The completion must adhere to standard grammatical conventions while preserving the reflective and structured tone characteristic of Stoic teachings.", "question": "<em>\"Aurelius asserts that tranquility rests not on external events but on the discipline of one\u2019s mind ______\"</em>", "A": "and that true strength arises, from within.", "B": "true strength arising from within.", "C": "and that true strength arises from within.", "D": "true strength arises: from within.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Choice <strong>A</strong> is correct because it appropriately connects the two independent clauses with and while maintaining the logical flow and reflective tone of the sentence. The conjunction ensures grammatical accuracy without unnecessary punctuation.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>B.</strong> The comma after arises is unnecessary and creates a grammatical error by improperly separating the verb and prepositional phrase.<strong>C.</strong> The participial phrase true strength arising alters the structure and leaves the sentence incomplete, making it grammatically incorrect.<strong>D.</strong> The colon is inappropriate as it suggests a list or elaboration that does not fit the structure or logic of the sentence."}
