{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Great Expectations</em>, Dickens reflects on how pivotal events shape an individual's life, often with lasting and unforeseen consequences. The following sentence mirrors Dickens\u2019s reflective tone and requires the correct punctuation to balance dependent and independent clauses. Your task is to select the option that aligns with Standard English conventions and preserves the sentence's thoughtful flow.", "question": "<em>\"Dickens suggests that a single day can influence the entire course of a life ______\"</em>", "A": "forging a chain of events: that are iron or gold.", "B": "forging a chain of events that are iron or gold.", "C": "forging a chain of events, that are iron, or gold.", "D": "forging a chain of events that are iron, or gold.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Choice <strong>B</strong> is correct because it presents a clean and logical structure without unnecessary punctuation. The phrase forging a chain of events that are iron or gold is clear and cohesive, aligning with Dickens\u2019s contemplative tone.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>A.</strong> The comma before or gold is unnecessary and disrupts the sentence\u2019s flow, introducing a punctuation error.<strong>C.</strong> The comma after events and before that is incorrect because it separates the subject from the predicate, breaking the sentence's grammatical structure.<strong>D.</strong> The colon is misused here because the second clause is not an explanation or a list; it is a continuation of the main idea."}
