The phrase and therefore should be used wisely to accomplish purposeful tasks is straightforward and does not include unnecessary punctuation, reflecting Franklin\u2019s clear and direct tone.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>A.</strong> The comma before to accomplish purposeful tasks is unnecessary and disrupts the sentence flow, introducing a punctuation error.<strong>B.</strong> While grammatically correct, the added commas around therefore create a slightly more formal tone that is inconsistent with Franklin\u2019s simple and direct writing style.<strong>C.</strong> The multiple commas disrupt the sentence\u2019s rhythm and make the sentence unnecessarily complex, diverging from the concise style of Franklin\u2019s prose."}
