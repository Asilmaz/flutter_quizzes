The absence of unnecessary punctuation ensures the sentence reads smoothly.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>A.</strong> The comma after and disrupts the sentence\u2019s flow and introduces a punctuation error, as no pause is needed in this context.<strong>C.</strong> The semicolon incorrectly separates a dependent phrase, which should remain connected to the preceding clause.<strong>D.</strong> The colon is inappropriate here, as it implies a list or explanation that does not fit the sentence structure or meaning."}
