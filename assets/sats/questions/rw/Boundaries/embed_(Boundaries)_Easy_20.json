{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Histories</em>, Herodotus reflects on the limitations of human power and knowledge. His sentences often weave descriptive imagery with philosophical undertones, requiring careful attention to punctuation and sentence structure. The following sentence mimics Herodotus\u2019s tone and style, testing your ability to apply proper grammar while maintaining logical cohesion.", "question": "<em>\"Herodotus compares human life to a river, constantly flowing forward ______\"</em>", "A": "its path determined by forces, greater than mankind\u2019s control.", "B": "its path, determined by forces greater than mankind\u2019s control.", "C": "its path determined by forces greater than mankind\u2019s control.", "D": "its path being determined by forces greater than mankind\u2019s control.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Choice <strong>A</strong> is correct because it maintains a smooth, logical flow while adhering to proper punctuation rules. The clause its path determined by forces greater than mankind\u2019s control is a natural continuation of the main sentence, requiring no additional punctuation to disrupt the rhythm.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>B.</strong> The unnecessary comma after path introduces a pause that fragments the sentence, disrupting the fluidity and creating a grammatical error.<strong>C.</strong> The comma after forces is incorrect, as it separates the subject and predicate unnecessarily, breaking the sentence\u2019s grammatical structure.<strong>D.</strong> The phrase being determined by forces unnecessarily complicates the sentence and makes it less concise and elegant."}
