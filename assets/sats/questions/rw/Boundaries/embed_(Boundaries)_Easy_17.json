{"introduction": "", "text": "Cicero\u2019s philosophical work examines the principles guiding moral action, focusing on the pursuit of good and the avoidance of evil. The following sentence reflects his logical and structured tone, requiring careful punctuation to clarify the relationship between clauses while maintaining grammatical correctness.", "question": "<em>\"Cicero argues that moral choices stem from reason, which distinguishes the pursuit of good ______\"</em>", "A": "from the avoidance of evil, ensuring harmony.", "B": "from the avoidance of evil; and ensures harmony.", "C": "from the avoidance of evil: and ensures harmony.", "D": "from the avoidance of evil, and ensures harmony.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Choice <strong>A</strong> is correct because it uses a comma to separate two independent clauses connected by and, ensuring proper grammatical flow. The sentence structure reflects Cicero\u2019s balanced reasoning and logical tone, clearly linking the ideas of moral pursuit and harmony.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>B.</strong> The semicolon disrupts the connection between the clauses, incorrectly separating the dependent clause (and ensures harmony) from the rest of the sentence.<strong>C.</strong> The colon implies an explanation or elaboration, which is inappropriate in this context because the second clause does not explain or expand on the first.<strong>D.</strong> While grammatically possible, ensuring harmony creates a participial phrase that alters the sentence\u2019s emphasis and flow, deviating from Cicero\u2019s structured tone."}
