{"introduction": "", "text": "Marcus Aurelius\u2019s <em>Meditations</em> urges readers to approach daily struggles with understanding and reason. His emphasis on self-awareness and the shared rationality of humanity underscores his Stoic philosophy.

This construction matches Aurelius\u2019s logical yet reflective tone and emphasizes the importance of understanding without unnecessary punctuation.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>B.</strong> The semicolon is inappropriate because it disrupts the sentence flow and incorrectly separates the conjunction and from its clause.<strong>C.</strong> The participial phrase striving for understanding alters the sentence structure, making the latter part of the sentence dependent and incomplete.<strong>D.</strong> The dash introduces an overly dramatic pause that is inconsistent with Aurelius\u2019s measured and logical tone."}
