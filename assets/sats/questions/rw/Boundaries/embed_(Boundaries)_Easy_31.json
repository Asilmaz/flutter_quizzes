The sentence flows smoothly, reflecting the complexity of Orwell\u2019s ideas without overcomplicating the structure.<strong>Why Others Are Incorrect:</strong><strong>B.</strong> The comma after shape is unnecessary and interrupts the sentence\u2019s flow, creating a grammatical error.<strong>C.</strong> The semicolon after present improperly separates the dependent clause from the main idea, breaking the sentence structure.<strong>D.</strong> The colon is misused here, as it suggests that the second clause is an explanation or list, which does not fit the intended meaning."}
