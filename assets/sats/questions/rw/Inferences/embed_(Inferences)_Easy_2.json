{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em>, Walter Isaacson describes the development of the first programmable computer during World War II. He notes that government funding for this technology was largely motivated by the need for faster calculations to aid in military operations, such as code-breaking and ballistics. After the war, these computers became available for civilian use, leading to breakthroughs in science, business, and communication. This transition suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "technological advancements often progress faster during peacetime than during wartime.", "B": "technologies developed for specific purposes can later have broader applications.", "C": "military funding is essential for the development of civilian technology.", "D": "the first programmable computers were more advanced than modern computers in certain aspects.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice C</strong> is the best answer. The passage emphasizes how programmable computers initially developed for military purposes later became vital for civilian applications, supporting the idea of broader technological applicability.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text does not compare technological progress during wartime and peacetime.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. While military funding was crucial, the passage does not claim it is essential for all technological advancements.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. There is no indication that the first programmable computers were superior to modern ones in any way.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
