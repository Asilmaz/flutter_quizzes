{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</em>, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein examine how choice architecture influences decision-making. They describe an experiment in which employees were offered two savings plans: one required manual enrollment, while the other automatically enrolled employees but allowed them to opt out. The automatic enrollment plan resulted in significantly higher participation rates, even though both plans provided the same benefits. Thaler and Sunstein argue that small changes in how choices are presented can dramatically influence behavior without restricting freedom, demonstrating the power of nudges. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "small adjustments in choice presentation can effectively influence decision-making without limiting freedom.", "B": "automatic enrollment plans reduce participation rates compared to manual enrollment plans.", "C": "manual enrollment plans are equally effective as automatic ones for encouraging participation.", "D": "employees are less likely to participate in savings plans that offer too many options.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Thaler and Sunstein highlight how automatic enrollment, a small adjustment in choice architecture, significantly increased participation while maintaining individual freedom.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text clearly states that automatic enrollment increased participation rates, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The experiment demonstrated that manual enrollment was less effective than automatic enrollment.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While decision-making is influenced by choice architecture, the text does not discuss the impact of too many options in this context.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
