{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Edward O. Wilson explores the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. He describes a study showing that when forests are divided into smaller patches by roads or urban development, species populations decline significantly. Wilson explains that these fragmented habitats isolate species, reducing their genetic diversity and making them more vulnerable to extinction. He argues that interconnected habitats are essential for maintaining biodiversity and preventing ecological collapse. This perspective underscores the importance of large-scale conservation efforts to protect and restore connected ecosystems. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "fragmented habitats are equally effective as continuous ones in supporting biodiversity.", "B": "species in fragmented habitats adapt better than those in continuous ecosystems.", "C": "habitat fragmentation rarely impacts the genetic diversity or survival of species.", "D": "maintaining connected habitats is critical to preserving biodiversity and preventing extinction.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wilson emphasizes the importance of connected habitats in maintaining biodiversity and preventing ecological collapse, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the disadvantages of fragmented habitats in supporting species diversity, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text explicitly states that habitat fragmentation reduces genetic diversity and increases extinction risks, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that species in fragmented habitats face greater challenges, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
