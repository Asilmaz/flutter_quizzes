{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman explores the problem-solving abilities of avian species. She describes an experiment where crows were presented with a puzzle box containing food. The crows had to use a stick to trigger a lever that released the reward. Ackerman notes that the crows solved the puzzle by trial and error and retained the solution for future attempts. She argues that such behaviors demonstrate advanced cognitive skills, comparable to those observed in primates, and suggest that intelligence in birds has evolved in unique ways to suit their environments. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "crows\u2019 problem-solving abilities are instinctual rather than learned.", "B": "birds can demonstrate advanced cognitive skills, including problem-solving and memory.", "C": "avian intelligence is less adaptable than the cognitive abilities of primates.", "D": "puzzle-solving in birds is primarily driven by random chance rather than learned behavior.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Ackerman highlights how crows solved complex puzzles and remembered solutions, illustrating their advanced cognitive abilities.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes that the crows learned through trial and error, suggesting their abilities are not purely instinctual.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While avian intelligence is unique, the text does not claim it is less adaptable than primates\u2019 abilities.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that the crows retained solutions, indicating their actions were not purely random.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
