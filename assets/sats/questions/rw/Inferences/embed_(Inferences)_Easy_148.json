{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee discusses the role of genetic mutations in human evolution. He examines the case of the mutation that causes sickle cell anemia, which also provides resistance to malaria. Mukherjee explains that while this mutation has harmful effects in some cases, it has persisted in regions where malaria is common due to the survival advantage it offers. He argues that mutations often come with trade-offs, where the benefits in one context may lead to risks in another. This perspective illustrates how evolution shapes genetic traits based on environmental pressures. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "the benefits of genetic mutations are often balanced by potential risks, depending on the environment.", "B": "genetic mutations are always either harmful or beneficial, with no middle ground.", "C": "mutations like sickle cell anemia have no lasting impact on a population\u2019s genetic diversity.", "D": "environmental factors play no role in determining the survival of genetic mutations.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee highlights how genetic mutations can provide both benefits and risks, depending on the environmental context, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explains that mutations can have both positive and negative effects, not strictly one or the other.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes how mutations like sickle cell anemia contribute to genetic diversity and survival, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage stresses that environmental factors directly influence which mutations are beneficial, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
