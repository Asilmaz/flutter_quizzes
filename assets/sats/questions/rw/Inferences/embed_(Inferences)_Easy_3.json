	"text": "In a long-term study of migratory birds, researchers noted that populations shifted their flight paths farther north when winters grew milder, yet returned to more southerly routes after unusually cold years. These observations suggest that ______.",
	"question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
	"A": "changes in climate patterns directly impact the paths migratory birds choose each season.",
	"B": "birds will permanently settle in northern areas if they experience several mild winters in a row.",
	"C": "individual bird species can tolerate temperature variations more readily than humans assume.",
	"D": "migratory patterns of birds were largely unaffected by historical climate fluctuations.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "<strong>Choice A</strong> is the best answer. The shift in flight paths with temperature changes suggests a direct link between climate variations and migratory routes. <br><strong>Choice B</strong> is too speculative, <strong>Choice C</strong> lacks direct support, and <strong>Choice D</strong> contradicts the data.<h3>Question Difficulty: Hard</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"
