{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less</em>, Barry Schwartz explores how sensory experiences influence decision-making.

The passage does not suggest that taste alone makes consumers less likely to choose premium products.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text implies that free samples positively influence perception and does not discourage their use.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text suggests the opposite\u2014that physical interaction increases appeal rather than reducing objectivity.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
