{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman examines the advanced problem-solving abilities of certain bird species. She describes a study where New Caledonian crows were presented with a series of tasks requiring them to use tools in sequence to access food. The crows demonstrated not only the ability to plan ahead but also the flexibility to modify their actions when the conditions changed. Ackerman argues that these behaviors suggest a level of cognitive complexity that rivals that of some primates. This finding underscores how environmental pressures drive the evolution of intelligence in diverse species. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "birds are incapable of modifying their actions to solve complex problems.", "B": "problem-solving abilities in birds demonstrate advanced cognitive flexibility and adaptability.", "C": "tool use in birds is purely instinctual and unaffected by environmental pressures.", "D": "cognitive complexity in birds is limited to New Caledonian crows and has no broader implications.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Ackerman highlights the crows\u2019 advanced problem-solving abilities, flexibility, and adaptability, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that birds like New Caledonian crows can modify their actions to solve problems, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text explicitly attributes the development of problem-solving abilities to environmental pressures, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Ackerman implies that these findings have broader implications for understanding cognitive evolution in various species, not just crows.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
