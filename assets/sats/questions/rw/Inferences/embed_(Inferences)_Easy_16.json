{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben explains how trees in forests communicate through underground networks of fungi known as mycorrhizal networks. He describes an experiment in which older trees transferred nutrients to younger, shaded trees unable to produce enough energy through photosynthesis. This process, Wohlleben suggests, is essential for maintaining the health and stability of the forest. The experiment also found that trees of different species participated in this nutrient-sharing, indicating a cooperative relationship. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "mycorrhizal networks may play a critical role in sustaining forest ecosystems.", "B": "older trees only share nutrients with trees of the same species.", "C": "trees that do not share nutrients are more likely to survive in competitive environments.", "D": "mycorrhizal networks primarily benefit younger trees at the expense of older trees.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The experiment shows that nutrient-sharing through mycorrhizal networks helps sustain the forest ecosystem, emphasizing their critical role.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that trees of different species shared nutrients.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text does not discuss a survival advantage for trees that do not share nutrients.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While younger trees benefit, the text does not indicate that this occurs at the expense of older trees.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
