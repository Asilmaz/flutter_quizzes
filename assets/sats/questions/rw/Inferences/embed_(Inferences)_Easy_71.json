{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee discusses the role of genetic mutations in shaping human evolution. He describes a case study of the CCR5-\u039432 mutation, which provides resistance to HIV in individuals who carry it. Mukherjee explains that this mutation likely became widespread in European populations due to its protective effects against diseases like the bubonic plague. He argues that natural selection often preserves mutations that offer survival advantages, even if they are rare. This discovery highlights the interplay between genetics and environmental pressures in determining the trajectory of human evolution. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic mutations are always harmful and reduce an individual\u2019s chances of survival.", "B": "beneficial genetic mutations can become widespread in populations due to environmental pressures.", "C": "mutations that protect against diseases are often eliminated by natural selection over time.", "D": "the CCR5-\u039432 mutation provides protection against all diseases in individuals who carry it.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee highlights how the CCR5-\u039432 mutation spread due to its protective benefits, illustrating how natural selection preserves advantageous traits.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes that some mutations, like CCR5-\u039432, are beneficial and increase survival chances.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage shows that beneficial mutations are preserved by natural selection, not eliminated.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The CCR5-\u039432 mutation is described as providing protection against specific diseases, not all diseases.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
