{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman examines the concept of anchoring, a cognitive bias where individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter when making decisions. He describes an experiment in which participants were asked to estimate the number of African countries in the United Nations after being shown either a high or low number on a spinning wheel. Those who saw a high number were likely to estimate a higher number of African countries than those who saw a low number, even though the two groups were given no relevant information. Kahneman argues that this shows how easily people are influenced by arbitrary information. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "people are rarely influenced by irrelevant information when making decisions.", "B": "anchoring biases can distort judgment, even when the initial information is irrelevant.", "C": "individuals can make accurate decisions without being influenced by initial information.", "D": "the order in which information is presented has no effect on decision-making.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice C</strong> is the best answer. Kahneman explains how the initial information (the number on the wheel) distorts participants\u2019 estimates, illustrating the effect of anchoring bias in decision-making.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage clearly shows how people are influenced by irrelevant information, which contradicts this statement.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. The experiment demonstrates that people\u2019s decisions are influenced by the initial number, making it clear that they are not always accurate.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly shows that the order in which information is presented has a significant effect on decision-making, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
