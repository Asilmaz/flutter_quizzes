{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World</em>, Steve Brusatte describes how fossilized footprints reveal details about dinosaur behavior. He highlights a discovery of parallel tracks that suggest a group of herbivorous dinosaurs traveled together, likely for protection against predators. Brusatte explains that the consistency in stride length and track spacing indicates coordinated movement within the group, a behavior similar to modern herd animals. He argues that this finding challenges the notion of dinosaurs as solitary creatures, instead presenting them as highly social and cooperative. This evidence suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "herbivorous dinosaurs primarily traveled alone to avoid attracting predators.", "B": "solitary behaviors were more common in herbivorous dinosaurs than in predators.", "C": "dinosaurs\u2019 survival depended solely on their ability to form protective herds.", "D": "fossilized footprints can provide insights into the social behavior of ancient species.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Brusatte emphasizes how fossilized tracks offer evidence of social behaviors, showing how these discoveries illuminate ancient species' interactions.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage discusses group travel for protection, not solitary movement.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While herding behavior offered protection, the text does not suggest it was the sole factor in dinosaur survival.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights social behaviors in herbivorous dinosaurs, not a preference for solitude.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
