{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben investigates the interconnectedness of trees in forest ecosystems. He describes how older trees use underground fungal networks to share nutrients with nearby saplings, which may be struggling to grow in low-light conditions. Wohlleben compares this behavior to a nurturing relationship, where the established trees support the younger ones to ensure the overall health of the forest. He argues that this interconnected system allows forests to function as a unified organism, where cooperation enhances survival and resilience. This observation highlights the importance of interconnected networks in maintaining ecological balance. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "trees in forests operate independently, competing for resources with little cooperation.", "B": "older trees prioritize their own growth over sharing resources with saplings.", "C": "underground fungal networks provide no significant benefits to forest ecosystems.", "D": "interconnected networks in forests promote mutual support and ecological stability.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben emphasizes how fungal networks foster cooperation and stability within forest ecosystems, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage focuses on the cooperative nature of trees, contradicting the idea of independent competition.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights the significant role of fungal networks in resource-sharing and ecosystem health, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Wohlleben explicitly states that older trees share resources to support saplings, contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
