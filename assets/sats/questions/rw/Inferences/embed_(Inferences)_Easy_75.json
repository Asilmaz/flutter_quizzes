{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman discusses how people assess risks and probabilities when making decisions. He describes an experiment where participants were asked to choose between two gambles: one offering an 80% chance to win $4,000, and the other offering a 100% chance to win $3,000. Most participants chose the guaranteed $3,000, even though the expected value of the first option was higher. Kahneman explains that this behavior is driven by risk aversion, as individuals tend to prefer certainty over higher potential rewards. This finding highlights how human psychology influences decision-making under uncertainty. This suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "people consistently choose the option with the highest expected value when faced with risks.", "B": "risk aversion can lead individuals to prefer guaranteed outcomes over potentially greater rewards.", "C": "individuals are more likely to take risks when guaranteed options are presented.", "D": "probabilities have little effect on decision-making when potential rewards are high.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kahneman\u2019s experiment demonstrates that participants preferred the guaranteed outcome due to risk aversion, even though it offered a lower expected value.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly shows that participants did not choose the higher expected value option, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text illustrates the opposite: individuals are less likely to take risks when a guaranteed option is available.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights that probabilities significantly influence decisions, particularly due to risk aversion.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
