{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World</em>, Steve Brusatte examines how certain dinosaur species adapted to their environments, enabling them to dominate ecosystems for millions of years. He discusses the evolution of feathers in theropod dinosaurs, which were initially used for insulation and later adapted for flight in early birds. Brusatte argues that such evolutionary innovations often began as small, functional changes before becoming major adaptations that reshaped ecosystems. He highlights how the ability to adapt gave some species a survival advantage over others, especially during periods of environmental change. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "evolutionary adaptations in dinosaurs rarely influenced their survival or ecosystem roles.", "B": "adaptations like feathers evolved solely to enable flight in theropod dinosaurs.", "C": "small functional changes in species can lead to significant evolutionary advantages over time.", "D": "theropod dinosaurs were unable to adapt effectively to environmental changes, leading to their extinction.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Brusatte emphasizes how small changes, like the evolution of feathers, provided significant survival advantages, leading to major evolutionary adaptations.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that adaptations played a crucial role in shaping species\u2019 survival and ecological impact.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While feathers were eventually adapted for flight, the text indicates they initially served other purposes, such as insulation.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the adaptability of theropods, not their inability to survive environmental changes.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
