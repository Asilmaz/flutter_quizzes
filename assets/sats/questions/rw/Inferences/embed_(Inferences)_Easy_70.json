{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Edward O. Wilson examines the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. He describes a study where researchers found that large, continuous forests support more diverse species than fragmented ones. Wilson explains that fragmentation isolates populations, making them more vulnerable to extinction due to limited resources and reduced genetic diversity. He argues that preserving large, connected habitats is essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and promoting species survival. This finding highlights the importance of addressing habitat fragmentation in conservation efforts. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "fragmented habitats are better at preserving genetic diversity than continuous ones.", "B": "preserving large, connected habitats is critical for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem health.", "C": "smaller, fragmented habitats are equally effective as large ones in supporting diverse species.", "D": "habitat fragmentation has little impact on the survival of species in ecosystems.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wilson emphasizes the importance of large, connected habitats in supporting biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem stability, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text demonstrates that fragmented habitats reduce genetic diversity, not preserve it.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the advantages of large, continuous habitats over fragmented ones, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text explicitly states that habitat fragmentation negatively impacts species survival, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
