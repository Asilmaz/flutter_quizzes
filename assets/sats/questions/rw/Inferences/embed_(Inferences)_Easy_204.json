{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>1984</em>, George Orwell presents a dystopian society ruled by the Party, a totalitarian regime that seeks to control every aspect of its citizens' lives. The protagonist, Winston Smith, works for the Party rewriting history to fit its narrative. Despite the Party\u2019s control over truth, Winston begins to question the system and seeks to resist its oppression. His relationship with Julia, a fellow rebel, further complicates his internal struggle as he tries to reconcile his desire for personal freedom with the overwhelming power of the Party. Orwell\u2019s portrayal of Winston\u2019s experience suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "individual rebellion is futile in the face of absolute political power, and personal freedom is irrelevant in a controlled society.", "B": "the desire for personal freedom and truth is inherently in conflict with oppressive political systems that manipulate reality and suppress dissent.", "C": "even the most oppressive regimes can be defeated by a few individuals, but this requires large-scale revolutions and mass support.", "D": "political oppression can be overcome when individuals work together to resist the government, as unity leads to strength and success.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice D</strong> is the best answer. Orwell\u2019s novel highlights how Winston\u2019s struggle for personal freedom and truth is at odds with the Party\u2019s manipulation of reality and its total control over individuals. Winston\u2019s internal conflict and eventual failure illustrate how oppressive political systems suppress both personal freedom and truth.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While Winston\u2019s rebellion ultimately fails, Orwell critiques the Party\u2019s control, suggesting that resistance is not entirely futile, even though the power dynamics are overwhelmingly skewed in favor of the regime.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. The novel shows that individual rebellion against the Party is essentially powerless without broader societal support, but it does not suggest that collective rebellion will necessarily succeed.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The novel does not focus on large-scale revolutions or mass support; rather, it critiques the individual\u2019s inability to break free from the Party\u2019s pervasive control, even in the face of personal resistance.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
