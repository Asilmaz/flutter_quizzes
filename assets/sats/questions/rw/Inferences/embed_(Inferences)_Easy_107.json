{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman explains the concept of loss aversion, a cognitive bias where people fear losses more than they value equivalent gains. He describes an experiment in which participants were asked to choose between two bets: one offering a 50% chance to win $100 or lose $50, and another offering a guaranteed $40. Most participants chose the guaranteed $40, even though the expected value of the first option was higher. Kahneman argues that this behavior demonstrates how loss aversion impacts decision-making, often leading individuals to prioritize certainty over potential benefit. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "loss aversion has no significant effect on how people evaluate risks and benefits.", "B": "people are naturally inclined to take risks when there is a possibility of greater rewards.", "C": "fear of losses can outweigh the potential for equivalent or greater gains in decision-making.", "D": "individuals are unaffected by uncertainty when making financial decisions.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kahneman\u2019s discussion of loss aversion demonstrates how the fear of losses influences decision-making, even when potential gains are greater.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes that loss aversion plays a significant role in risk evaluation, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text shows that people tend to avoid risk in favor of certainty, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights that uncertainty significantly affects decision-making, making this statement inaccurate.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
