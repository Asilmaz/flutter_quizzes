{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Edward O. Wilson examines how habitat destruction accelerates species extinction. He describes a study showing that when rainforests are fragmented by roads and development, isolated animal populations lose access to resources and face increased competition. Wilson emphasizes that smaller habitats support fewer species, reducing biodiversity and destabilizing ecosystems. He argues that interconnected habitats are vital for preserving genetic diversity and ensuring species\u2019 survival. This perspective underscores the importance of large-scale conservation efforts to maintain ecological balance and prevent widespread species loss. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "preserving large, connected habitats is critical for maintaining biodiversity and ecological stability.", "B": "fragmented habitats support biodiversity as effectively as interconnected ones.", "C": "habitat destruction has little effect on genetic diversity or species survival.", "D": "ecosystems are rarely affected by the fragmentation of habitats.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wilson highlights the role of connected habitats in supporting biodiversity and preventing ecological collapse, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explains that fragmented habitats are less effective in supporting biodiversity, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. Wilson discusses the severe effects of habitat destruction on genetic diversity and species survival, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage illustrates that ecosystem stability is significantly impacted by habitat fragmentation, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
