{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em>, Robin Wall Kimmerer explores the relationship between Indigenous knowledge and environmental science. She describes how sweetgrass, a plant used in traditional ceremonies, thrives best when it is regularly harvested. Kimmerer recounts a study where patches of sweetgrass that were sustainably harvested grew back stronger, while unharvested patches declined in health. This pattern aligns with Indigenous teachings that emphasize reciprocity between humans and the natural world. Kimmerer argues that such practices can help restore ecosystems degraded by modern approaches. This suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "traditional harvesting practices may be more effective at maintaining ecosystems than leaving them untouched.", "B": "ecosystems benefit most when human activity is entirely removed from natural processes.", "C": "plants that thrive under sustainable harvesting are less likely to be used in ceremonial contexts.", "D": "Indigenous knowledge is limited in application compared to modern scientific methods.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The passage explains that sustainably harvested sweetgrass thrived, aligning with Indigenous practices that emphasize active participation in ecosystem health, suggesting these practices can outperform non-intervention approaches.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text directly contradicts this by showing that non-intervention led to decline.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not discuss ceremonial contexts as being a factor in plant growth.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text suggests Indigenous knowledge complements and can inform modern environmental approaches, not that it is limited.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
