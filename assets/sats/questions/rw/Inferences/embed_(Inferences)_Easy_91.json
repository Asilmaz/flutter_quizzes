{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman examines the cognitive biases that influence decision-making. He describes a phenomenon called the availability heuristic, where individuals assess the probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. Kahneman illustrates this with an experiment in which participants were asked whether more words in the English language begin with the letter \u201cR\u201d or have \u201cR\u201d as the third letter. Most participants incorrectly believed that words beginning with \u201cR\u201d were more common because they could more easily recall examples, even though the opposite is true. This finding highlights how reliance on readily available information can lead to flawed judgments. This suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "people rely solely on logic and statistics when assessing probabilities.", "B": "the \"availability heuristic\" ensures more accurate decision-making in all cases.", "C": "the availability of information can skew perceptions and lead to inaccurate conclusions.", "D": "individuals are unlikely to use heuristics when making everyday decisions.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kahneman emphasizes that easily recalled information can distort perceptions, leading to flawed judgments, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text illustrates that individuals often rely on heuristics rather than logic or statistics when assessing probabilities.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage shows that the availability heuristic often leads to errors, refuting the claim that it ensures accuracy.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text explicitly discusses how heuristics are a common feature of everyday decision-making, contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
