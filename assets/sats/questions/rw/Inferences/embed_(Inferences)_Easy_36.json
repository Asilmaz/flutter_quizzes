{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert describes the extinction of the great auk, a flightless bird once abundant in the North Atlantic. She explains that overhunting by humans during the 19th century led to the species\u2019 rapid disappearance. Kolbert notes that while some conservationists tried to protect the remaining birds, their efforts came too late, as the last known breeding pair was killed for museum specimens. She argues that human activity often accelerates extinction by targeting species already vulnerable due to limited populations or specialized habitats. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "conservation efforts are always unsuccessful once a species becomes endangered.", "B": "human activity frequently exacerbates extinction risks for species with small populations.", "C": "species with specialized habitats are less likely to face extinction than generalist species.", "D": "overhunting was the primary cause of extinction for most species during the 19th century.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kolbert highlights how human hunting accelerated the extinction of a species already vulnerable due to its limited population, aligning with the idea that human activity exacerbates extinction risks.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text mentions late conservation efforts but does not claim that all such efforts are always unsuccessful.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes vulnerability in species with specialized habitats, not their resistance to extinction.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While overhunting was a significant factor, the text does not generalize this as the primary cause for all 19th-century extinctions.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
