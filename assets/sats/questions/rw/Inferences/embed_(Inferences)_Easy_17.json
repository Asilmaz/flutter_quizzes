{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions</em>, Dan Ariely examines how pricing strategies influence consumer behavior. He discusses an experiment where customers were presented with two subscription options: one with access to digital content only, and the other including both digital and print content for the same price. Surprisingly, most customers chose the second option, even though the digital-only option cost less. Ariely argues that the inclusion of the seemingly better deal (print and digital) made the more expensive option more appealing. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "customers are likely to avoid digital subscriptions unless a print option is available.", "B": "consumers often prefer the most comprehensive option, regardless of its price.", "C": "perceived value, rather than actual utility, plays a significant role in purchasing decisions.", "D": "print subscriptions are inherently more valuable to consumers than digital subscriptions.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice C</strong> is the best answer. Ariely's discussion highlights how consumers' perception of value (a better deal) influences their choice, regardless of the utility of the options.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text does not suggest that customers avoid digital-only subscriptions entirely.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. While the comprehensive option was chosen more often, the reasoning tied to perceived value, not just preference for completeness.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The preference for the print-and-digital option does not indicate that print subscriptions are inherently more valuable, only that they appear so due to the pricing strategy.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
