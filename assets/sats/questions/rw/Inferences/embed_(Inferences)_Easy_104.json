{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman explores the intelligence of avian species and their ability to solve complex problems. She describes an experiment in which kea parrots were presented with a puzzle requiring multiple steps to unlock a box containing food. The parrots demonstrated remarkable problem-solving skills by using trial and error to figure out the sequence of actions needed. Ackerman argues that such behaviors illustrate cognitive flexibility and adaptability, challenging traditional assumptions about the limitations of bird intelligence. This finding highlights the importance of environmental pressures in shaping cognitive abilities across species. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "cognitive flexibility in birds allows them to adapt to challenges and solve complex tasks.", "B": "birds lack the cognitive flexibility to solve complex problems without external guidance.", "C": "problem-solving in birds is entirely instinctual and not influenced by environmental factors.", "D": "kea parrots rely solely on repetitive behavior rather than adaptability in problem-solving.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Ackerman emphasizes the cognitive flexibility and adaptability of kea parrots, demonstrating their ability to solve complex problems.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the parrots\u2019 ability to independently solve problems, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text illustrates that problem-solving in birds involves adaptability and learning, not just instinct.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The parrots demonstrated adaptability through trial and error, contradicting the claim of reliance solely on repetitive behavior.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
