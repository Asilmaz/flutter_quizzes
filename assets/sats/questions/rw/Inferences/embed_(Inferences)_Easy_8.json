{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman examines the remarkable problem-solving skills of certain bird species. She describes how New Caledonian crows create tools out of twigs to extract insects from tree bark. In one study, researchers observed that the crows crafted more intricate tools when food was harder to access, demonstrating an ability to adapt their behavior to solve complex challenges. Ackerman notes that the crows also protect their tools by hiding them in safe places when not in use. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "tool-making in birds may be more advanced in species that face frequent food shortages.", "B": "the ability to make tools is limited to a small number of highly intelligent bird species.", "C": "birds that use tools are less likely to survive in environments with abundant food sources.", "D": "New Caledonian crows exhibit a level of foresight not commonly seen in other animals.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The crows\u2019 behavior of crafting intricate tools and hiding them for future use indicates a level of planning and foresight uncommon among most animals.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While the crows adapted their tools for complex tasks, the passage does not suggest food shortages as the driver of this behavior.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not imply that tool-using birds are disadvantaged in environments with abundant food.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text focuses on New Caledonian crows and does not make broader claims about all intelligent bird species.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
