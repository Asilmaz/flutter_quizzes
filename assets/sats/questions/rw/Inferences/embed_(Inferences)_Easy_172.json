{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee explores the complex history of genetics and its profound impact on human life. He describes the discovery of the structure of DNA, the role of genes in determining traits, and the ongoing ethical debates surrounding genetic research. Mukherjee highlights how advances in genetics have led to breakthroughs in medicine, such as gene therapy, but also raised difficult questions about the potential for genetic engineering. He argues that while the potential to cure genetic diseases is promising, it must be balanced with careful consideration of the ethical implications. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "advances in genetics hold great promise, but they also require careful ethical consideration to avoid unintended consequences.", "B": "genetic research should proceed without any concern for ethical considerations, as the potential benefits outweigh the risks.", "C": "genetic engineering has no ethical implications and should be freely pursued without regulation.", "D": "the ethical debates surrounding genetic research are largely irrelevant to its potential medical benefits.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee emphasizes the potential of genetic research to revolutionize medicine, but also stresses the need for ethical oversight to balance these advancements with the risks involved.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. Mukherjee argues that genetic research must be approached with caution, acknowledging both its potential and its ethical complexities, which contradicts this statement.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text stresses the importance of considering ethical issues, making it clear that genetic engineering is not without its moral implications.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Mukherjee suggests that the ethical debates are crucial to ensuring responsible genetic research, so this statement is false.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
