{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</em>, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein explore how small changes in choice presentation can significantly impact decision-making. They discuss a study in which cafeteria food items were arranged so healthier options were more visible and accessible than less healthy ones. This simple change led to a significant increase in the selection of healthier foods without restricting choice. Thaler and Sunstein argue that \u201cnudges\u201d like these guide people toward better decisions while preserving their freedom of choice. This finding highlights how behavioral economics principles can shape outcomes in subtle but effective ways. This suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "restricting choice is more effective than rearranging options in influencing decisions.", "B": "individuals are unaffected by the presentation or arrangement of available choices.", "C": "subtle changes in choice architecture can encourage better decisions without limiting freedom.", "D": "healthier food options are chosen only when no other options are available.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Thaler and Sunstein emphasize how small changes in choice architecture, like rearranging food items, can guide decisions without restricting freedom, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The study demonstrates that choice arrangement, not restriction, effectively influenced behavior, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights that the presentation of choices significantly impacts decision-making, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text does not claim that healthier options are chosen only in the absence of alternatives, but rather that visibility influences selection.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
