{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman explores the intelligence and adaptability of avian species. She highlights an experiment in which New Caledonian crows were presented with multiple-step puzzles requiring them to use tools in sequence to access a food reward. The crows not only solved the puzzles but also adjusted their approach when encountering unexpected obstacles. Ackerman argues that such behavior demonstrates advanced problem-solving skills, often on par with those of primates, and suggests that intelligence evolves in diverse ways to meet environmental challenges. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "some bird species exhibit advanced problem-solving abilities comparable to primates.", "B": "tool use in birds is purely instinctual and lacks adaptability.", "C": "intelligence in birds evolves in similar ways to that of mammals, without variation.", "D": "New Caledonian crows struggle to solve complex problems without assistance.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Ackerman highlights the advanced problem-solving abilities of New Caledonian crows, demonstrating that their intelligence can rival that of primates.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes that the crows adjusted their behavior, indicating adaptability, not purely instinctual actions.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text discusses the diversity of intelligence evolution, not a single, uniform process.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that the crows solved complex problems independently, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
