{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman explains how people evaluate risks and rewards differently depending on how choices are presented. He describes an experiment where participants were given two options: one guaranteed to save 200 lives out of 600 at risk, and another with a 33% chance of saving all 600 lives and a 67% chance of saving none. Most participants chose the guaranteed option, even though the second option offered the same expected outcome. Kahneman argues that people tend to avoid risk when outcomes are framed as gains but are more willing to take risks when outcomes are framed as losses. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "decisions based on risk evaluation are unaffected by the framing of potential outcomes.", "B": "framing decisions in terms of guaranteed gains decreases risk aversion in most individuals.", "C": "people prefer riskier options when they perceive them as offering higher average rewards.", "D": "individuals are more likely to accept risk when presented with scenarios involving potential losses.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice A</strong> is the best answer. Kahneman\u2019s study highlights that framing outcomes as losses increases people\u2019s willingness to take risks, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes that guaranteed gains reduce risk-taking behavior, not increase it.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text shows that risk preferences are influenced by framing rather than strictly by perceived rewards.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The study specifically demonstrates that the framing of outcomes significantly affects risk evaluation, contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
