{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Edward O. Wilson discusses how human activity impacts biodiversity through habitat destruction and fragmentation. He describes a study showing that smaller, fragmented forests support fewer species compared to larger, continuous forests. Wilson explains that fragmented habitats isolate populations, making them more vulnerable to extinction due to limited genetic diversity and increased competition for resources. He argues that maintaining connected ecosystems is critical for preserving species and ensuring ecological stability. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness of habitats and the necessity of large-scale conservation efforts to sustain biodiversity. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "maintaining connected ecosystems is essential for preserving biodiversity and ecological stability.", "B": "fragmented habitats are equally effective as continuous ones in supporting biodiversity.", "C": "habitat destruction rarely affects genetic diversity or population survival.", "D": "smaller habitats are more resilient to environmental changes than larger ones.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wilson emphasizes the importance of connected ecosystems in preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the disadvantages of fragmented habitats in supporting species, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text explicitly states that habitat destruction reduces genetic diversity and population survival, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Wilson argues that larger, connected habitats are more effective at supporting species and ecosystems, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
