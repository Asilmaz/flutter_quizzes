{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em>, Walter Isaacson explores the role of collaboration in technological advancements. He highlights how the development of the transistor\u2014a critical component in modern electronics\u2014was achieved through the combined efforts of scientists and engineers with diverse expertise. Isaacson argues that breakthroughs in technology often occur not because of individual brilliance but due to the dynamic exchange of ideas among team members. He emphasizes that fostering an environment where collaboration thrives is essential for innovation. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "individual achievements are more critical to innovation than collaborative efforts.", "B": "the invention of the transistor was achieved without the input of collaborative teams.", "C": "collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise fosters significant technological advancements.", "D": "technological progress is largely independent of teamwork or shared ideas.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Isaacson emphasizes how collaboration and the exchange of ideas among diverse individuals led to the development of transformative technologies like the transistor.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights collaboration, not individual achievements, as the driving force behind innovation.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text specifically attributes the invention of the transistor to collaborative teamwork, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage clearly states that teamwork and shared ideas are fundamental to technological progress, contradicting this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
