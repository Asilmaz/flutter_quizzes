{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben examines the social interactions of trees in forests. He describes how older, established trees use underground fungal networks to support younger trees by sharing nutrients and water. Wohlleben explains that this cooperative behavior benefits the forest as a whole, as healthier young trees contribute to the stability of the ecosystem over time. He compares these interactions to a social system where stronger members help weaker ones for mutual survival. This finding emphasizes the importance of interconnectedness and resource-sharing in maintaining ecological balance. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "trees in forests function independently, with minimal reliance on shared resources.", "B": "underground fungal networks only benefit older trees, excluding younger ones.", "C": "younger trees are unable to survive without direct sunlight and external support.", "D": "cooperative resource-sharing among trees enhances the overall health of forest ecosystems.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben highlights the role of resource-sharing in fostering ecological balance and sustaining the health of forest ecosystems, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes cooperation and interconnectedness among trees, contradicting the idea of independence.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While younger trees receive support, the text does not state that sunlight is their sole or primary requirement for survival.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage specifically mentions that younger trees benefit from the fungal networks, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
