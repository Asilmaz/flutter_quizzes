{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines how genetic mutations shape human traits and survival. He discusses the sickle cell mutation, which alters the shape of red blood cells. While this mutation can cause health complications in individuals who inherit it from both parents, Mukherjee explains that those with a single copy of the gene are more resistant to malaria. This dual effect demonstrates how natural selection can favor traits that provide a survival advantage in specific environments, even if they pose risks under other conditions. This observation highlights the complex relationship between genetics and environmental pressures. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "traits that offer environmental advantages can persist despite associated health risks.", "B": "genetic mutations that pose risks are never favored by natural selection.", "C": "mutations like sickle cell reduce survival rates in all individuals who inherit them.", "D": "malaria resistance has little impact on the survival of individuals in high-risk regions.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee highlights how the sickle cell mutation persists due to its advantage in providing malaria resistance, even with its associated risks.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that natural selection can favor mutations with dual effects, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text specifies that individuals with one copy of the sickle cell gene benefit from malaria resistance, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes the significant role of malaria resistance in the survival of individuals in high-risk regions, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
