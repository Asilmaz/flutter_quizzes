{"introduction": "", "text": "In her book <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert examines how human activities have accelerated the extinction of many species. She highlights the case of the golden toad, which once thrived in the Monteverde Cloud Forest in Costa Rica. Scientists have linked the toad\u2019s extinction to a fungal disease that spread more quickly due to rising temperatures caused by climate change. Kolbert argues that this is part of a larger pattern where human-driven environmental changes create conditions unfavorable for many species to survive. This suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "the extinction of the golden toad was caused solely by natural processes unrelated to human activity.", "B": "conservation efforts will be most effective in regions with relatively stable climates.", "C": "climate change may lead to the decline of species unable to adapt to new environmental conditions.", "D": "scientists can reverse extinction trends by developing treatments for diseases like the fungal infection.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The passage links climate change to the extinction of the golden toad and emphasizes the broader impact of environmental changes on species, supporting the idea that climate change affects species unable to adapt.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly connects the golden toad\u2019s extinction to human-driven climate change, not solely natural processes.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text does not discuss where conservation efforts would be most effective.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While diseases are mentioned, the text does not suggest that treating diseases alone could reverse extinction trends.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
