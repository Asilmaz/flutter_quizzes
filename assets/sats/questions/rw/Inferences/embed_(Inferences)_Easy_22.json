{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions</em>, David Quammen explores how species adapt to isolated environments. He describes a study of Gal\u00e1pagos finches, which developed unique beak shapes based on their dietary needs. In areas with frequent droughts, finches with thicker, stronger beaks survived by cracking open tough seeds. Quammen highlights that this trait likely became more common over time due to natural selection. He argues that environmental pressures not only shape physical traits but also influence the survival strategies of species. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "species with specialized traits are less likely to adapt to environmental changes.", "B": "finches with thicker beaks are more likely to thrive in diverse environments than those with thinner beaks.", "C": "the survival of Gal\u00e1pagos finches depends entirely on their ability to consume tough seeds.", "D": "physical adaptations in isolated species often result from pressures unique to their habitat.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Quammen\u2019s discussion of finches adapting to drought conditions highlights how environmental pressures in isolated habitats drive specific physical adaptations.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that specialized traits make species less adaptable but rather highlights their value in specific conditions.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage uses tough seeds as an example but does not imply they are the sole factor in finch survival.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text does not claim that finches with thicker beaks thrive in diverse environments; it focuses on drought conditions specifically.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
