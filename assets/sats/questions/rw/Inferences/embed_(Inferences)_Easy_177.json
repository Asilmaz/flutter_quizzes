He discusses the discovery of DNA\u2019s structure and the role of genetics in shaping who we are, including our traits and susceptibility to diseases. Mukherjee examines both the promise and the ethical dilemmas of genetic research, noting that while genetic science offers potential cures for diseases, it also raises concerns about genetic engineering and the manipulation of life itself. He suggests that the rapid advancements in genetics must be approached with caution, balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. This suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic research should proceed without ethical considerations, as the benefits far outweigh any potential risks.", "B": "the rapid development of genetics poses no ethical challenges, as long as the research is well-funded.", "C": "genetic research is inherently dangerous and should be stopped to avoid ethical complications.", "D": "genetic advancements should be pursued, but they must be balanced with careful ethical considerations to avoid unintended consequences.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee highlights the importance of balancing the rapid advancements in genetics with ethical considerations, which supports this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage stresses the need for ethical oversight in genetic research, making this choice false.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While Mukherjee acknowledges the ethical concerns, he does not suggest halting genetic research entirely; rather, he calls for a careful, balanced approach.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that there are significant ethical challenges involved in genetic research, which makes this statement misleading.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
