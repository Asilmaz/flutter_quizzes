{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World</em>, Steve Brusatte explores the adaptive traits that allowed certain dinosaurs to thrive in changing environments. He describes how theropods, like <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, developed sharp teeth and strong jaws that made them apex predators. Brusatte explains that these adaptations gave theropods a survival advantage by allowing them to dominate ecosystems and outcompete rivals. He argues that evolutionary success often depends on a species' ability to adapt to ecological pressures through specialized traits. This perspective underscores the role of adaptation in the survival and proliferation of species. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "evolutionary success often relies on specialized adaptations that respond to ecological pressures.", "B": "theropods\u2019 specialized traits provided little advantage in their ecosystems.", "C": "traits like sharp teeth and strong jaws are unnecessary for survival in competitive ecosystems.", "D": "theropods\u2019 adaptations were insufficient to maintain their dominance in changing environments.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Brusatte emphasizes that adaptations like sharp teeth and strong jaws allowed theropods to thrive, supporting the conclusion that specialized traits drive evolutionary success.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the significant advantages these traits provided to theropods, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text explicitly states that these traits were crucial for survival and dominance in competitive ecosystems.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While theropods eventually went extinct, the passage focuses on their dominance during their time, not their eventual decline.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
