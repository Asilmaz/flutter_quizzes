{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee explores the role of genetic mutations in human adaptation. He describes the CCR5-delta32 mutation, which provides resistance to HIV in individuals who inherit it. Mukherjee explains that this mutation likely originated as a defense against another disease, such as smallpox, and has persisted in populations due to its survival advantage. He argues that mutations offering protective benefits in specific environments can spread even if their long-term effects are neutral or harmful under different conditions. This perspective highlights how genetic traits are shaped by historical and environmental factors. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic mutations with survival advantages are irrelevant to environmental factors.", "B": "mutations like CCR5-delta32 have no impact on survival or disease resistance in humans.", "C": "genetic adaptations rarely persist in populations beyond their initial environmental benefit.", "D": "mutations that provide resistance to diseases can spread through populations over time.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee highlights how mutations, such as CCR5-delta32, persist and spread due to the survival advantages they provide, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage specifically emphasizes the relevance of environmental factors in the spread of beneficial mutations, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text indicates that beneficial mutations do persist and can influence populations over time, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that mutations like CCR5-delta32 play a significant role in survival and disease resistance, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
