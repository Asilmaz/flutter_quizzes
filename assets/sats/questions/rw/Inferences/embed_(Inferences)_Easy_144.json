{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee explores how genetic mutations can have both beneficial and harmful effects on individuals. He discusses the case of the CCR5-delta32 mutation, which provides resistance to HIV. While this mutation can protect against HIV, it also increases the risk of certain other diseases, such as West Nile virus. Mukherjee argues that genetic mutations are shaped by environmental pressures, and their effects are often a trade-off between benefits and risks. This view underscores the complexity of evolution, where even advantageous traits can have unintended consequences. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic mutations often come with trade-offs, where benefits are balanced by potential risks.", "B": "genetic mutations are always either beneficial or harmful, with no intermediate effects.", "C": "mutations like CCR5-delta32 provide only positive effects and have no harmful consequences.", "D": "environmental pressures have no significant influence on the development of genetic mutations.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee discusses how genetic mutations often come with both positive and negative effects, highlighting the trade-offs between benefits and risks.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights that mutations can have both beneficial and harmful consequences, making this statement too simplistic.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. Mukherjee specifically mentions that the CCR5-delta32 mutation, while beneficial against HIV, also increases the risk of other diseases, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text stresses that genetic mutations are shaped by environmental pressures, directly contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
