{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who creates a living creature from dead tissue. Driven by ambition, Victor refuses to take responsibility for his creation, abandoning the creature and condemning it to a life of isolation and rejection. As the creature seeks revenge on its creator, Victor realizes the consequences of his unchecked ambition and neglect. Shelley uses Victor\u2019s tragic downfall and the creature\u2019s suffering to explore the dangers of blind ambition, the responsibilities that come with creation, and the destructive effects of isolation. This suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "unchecked ambition, when driven by a desire for personal glory, leads to inevitable success and fulfillment.", "B": "the consequences of neglecting one\u2019s responsibilities, especially toward those we create, can be disastrous and long-lasting.", "C": "isolation and rejection are only harmful when experienced by those who are weak or unable to stand up for themselves.", "D": "personal ambition is often more important than the moral implications of scientific progress, and ignoring the consequences is justified.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Shelley demonstrates that Victor\u2019s failure to take responsibility for his creation leads to the creature\u2019s suffering and his own downfall. The consequences of neglect and irresponsibility are central to the novel\u2019s theme.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The novel critiques blind ambition, showing that it leads to negative consequences rather than success or fulfillment. Victor\u2019s ambition leads to the destruction of both himself and his creature.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The creature\u2019s rejection and isolation are harmful to it, regardless of its strength or resilience. Shelley suggests that rejection is universally destructive, not just for the weak.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The novel argues that ambition must be tempered with responsibility, and scientific progress should not come at the expense of moral considerations. Ignoring the consequences of actions is shown to be tragic and unjustifiable.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
