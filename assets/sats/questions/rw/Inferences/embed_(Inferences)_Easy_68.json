{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert examines the role of human activity in accelerating species extinctions. She highlights the disappearance of coral reefs, explaining how rising ocean temperatures and acidification\u2014both driven by carbon emissions\u2014disrupt coral ecosystems. Kolbert describes a study showing that damaged reefs struggle to support marine biodiversity, leading to cascading effects throughout the food chain. She argues that human-driven environmental changes are causing rapid and widespread damage to ecosystems that evolved over millions of years. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "coral reefs are unaffected by rising ocean temperatures and acidification.", "B": "marine ecosystems are more adaptable to rapid environmental changes than terrestrial ecosystems.", "C": "human-induced environmental changes can have cascading effects on global biodiversity.", "D": "species dependent on coral reefs can survive without the ecosystems they rely on.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kolbert explains how human-induced changes, like rising temperatures and acidification, disrupt coral ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and food chains, demonstrating cascading effects.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes that coral reefs are significantly impacted by human-driven changes, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage focuses on the challenges faced by marine ecosystems, not a comparison to terrestrial ecosystems.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text suggests that species dependent on coral reefs struggle when these ecosystems are damaged, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
