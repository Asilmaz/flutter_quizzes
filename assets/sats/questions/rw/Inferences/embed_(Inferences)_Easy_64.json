{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams</em>, Matthew Walker examines how sleep affects memory and learning. He describes an experiment in which participants were asked to learn a list of words and then tested on their recall. One group took a nap before the test, while the other remained awake. The napping group performed significantly better, suggesting that sleep consolidates memories and improves retention. Walker argues that sleep is a critical component of the learning process, enabling the brain to process and organize new information. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "sleep deprivation has little impact on memory retention and recall.", "B": "napping is more effective for memory consolidation than a full night\u2019s sleep.", "C": "adequate sleep enhances the brain\u2019s ability to consolidate and recall learned information.", "D": "participants who remain awake are better able to retain and organize new information.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Walker emphasizes how sleep, including naps, strengthens memory and enhances recall, making it essential for learning.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The experiment shows that sleep deprivation negatively impacts memory retention, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights the benefits of sleep in general but does not claim napping is superior to a full night\u2019s sleep.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The study demonstrates that participants who napped performed better, contradicting this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
