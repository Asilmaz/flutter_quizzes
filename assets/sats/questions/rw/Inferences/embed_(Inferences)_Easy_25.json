{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Edward O. Wilson explores the unique adaptations of plants and animals in diverse ecosystems. He describes how pitcher plants in Southeast Asia have evolved specialized traps to capture prey, such as insects and small animals. In regions with nutrient-poor soil, these plants rely on their prey for essential nutrients like nitrogen. Wilson highlights a study where certain pitcher plants developed underground traps to access prey unavailable on the surface. This adaptation provided a competitive advantage in ecosystems with limited surface resources. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "underground traps help pitcher plants exploit resources that are inaccessible to other species.", "B": "pitcher plants in nutrient-rich soils are less likely to evolve specialized traps.", "C": "pitcher plants rely more on underground traps than on photosynthesis to survive.", "D": "nutrient-poor soil prevents most pitcher plants from thriving without human intervention.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The passage describes how underground traps allow pitcher plants to capture prey not available on the surface, giving them a competitive advantage.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While nutrient-poor soil drives adaptation, the text does not suggest that plants in nutrient-rich soils lack specialized traps entirely.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not claim that pitcher plants rely more on traps than photosynthesis, only that traps supplement their nutrients.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes the plants\u2019 adaptations, not their dependency on human intervention.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
