{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Wolves</em>, Jim and Jamie Dutcher document how wolf pack behavior adapts to environmental challenges. They describe a study in which wolves in areas with harsh winters displayed unique hunting strategies, such as ambushing prey in deep snow where movement was restricted. The researchers also observed that wolves with thicker fur and larger body sizes were more common in these regions, suggesting a genetic advantage for survival in colder climates. The Dutchers argue that environmental pressures not only shape behaviors but also influence the physical traits of wolf populations over time. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "hunting strategies are more important for wolf survival than physical adaptations.", "B": "wolves with smaller body sizes are better suited to survive in regions with harsh winters.", "C": "environmental pressures can lead to both behavioral and physical adaptations in wolf populations.", "D": "genetic traits like body size and fur thickness have little impact on a wolf pack\u2019s ability to hunt.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice A</strong> is the best answer. The study demonstrates that environmental conditions influence both the hunting behaviors and physical traits of wolves, showing the interplay of adaptation mechanisms.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes the advantage of larger body sizes and thicker fur in colder regions, not smaller body sizes.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While hunting strategies are important, the passage highlights the combined importance of behavior and physical traits.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that traits like fur thickness and body size are advantageous for survival, contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
