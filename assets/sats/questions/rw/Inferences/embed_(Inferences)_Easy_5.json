	"text": "Biologists investigating freshwater ecosystems discovered that crayfish populations fluctuate significantly based on the presence of large predatory fish. However, in lakes lacking such predators, crayfish populations also experience declines, indicating that other factors must be at play. Thus, the data imply that ______.",
	"question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
	"A": "predatory fish alone cannot account for major shifts in crayfish populations over time.",
	"B": "crayfish species rely more on plant matter than on smaller aquatic organisms for sustenance.",
	"C": "crayfish populations never fluctuate significantly in the presence of predatory fish.",
	"D": "the introduction of large predatory fish leads to a permanent imbalance in freshwater ecosystems.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "<strong>Choice A</strong> is the best answer. The observation that crayfish populations sometimes decline even without predators means other ecological factors must contribute. <br><strong>Choices B, C, and D</strong> do not logically follow from the data.<h3>Question Difficulty: Hard</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"
