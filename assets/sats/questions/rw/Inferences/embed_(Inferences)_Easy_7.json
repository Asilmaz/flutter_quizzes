{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Empathy Diaries: A Memoir</em>, Sherry Turkle discusses her research on human interaction with robots and how these interactions can shape trust. Turkle recalls a study in which participants interacted with a robot designed to assist elderly people. The robot was programmed to adjust its tone and response speed based on the perceived emotional state of the participant. Participants who felt the robot was empathetic were more likely to trust it and follow its recommendations. Turkle argues that designing robots to simulate empathy can significantly enhance their effectiveness in caregiving roles. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "caregiving robots will be less effective than human caregivers because they cannot truly feel empathy.", "B": "trust in caregiving robots is determined primarily by their ability to complete tasks quickly.", "C": "designing robots to simulate empathy is unnecessary because humans naturally adapt to robotic communication.", "D": "robots that exhibit empathy may improve trust and cooperation in caregiving environments.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice A</strong> is the best answer. The passage highlights that robots designed to simulate empathy foster trust and cooperation, aligning with the idea that empathetic design enhances caregiving robots' effectiveness.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. While the robot's responses were part of the study, speed was not presented as the primary factor in building trust.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage supports the value of empathetic design, contradicting the claim that such design is unnecessary.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes effectiveness through empathy simulation, not a direct comparison to human caregivers.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
