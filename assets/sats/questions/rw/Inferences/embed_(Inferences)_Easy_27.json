{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman discusses how prior information influences decision-making. He describes an experiment in which participants were shown two advertisements for the same product. One ad provided minimal details, while the other included extensive information about the product\u2019s features. Participants who saw the simpler ad first rated the product in the second ad more positively than those who saw the detailed ad first. Kahneman argues that initial impressions shape how subsequent information is perceived, emphasizing the importance of order in presenting ideas. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "consumers base their decisions primarily on the complexity of advertisements.", "B": "participants are likely to disregard information if it contradicts their initial impression of a product.", "C": "detailed advertisements are always more effective than simpler ones in influencing decisions.", "D": "initial impressions can influence how people evaluate later information about the same product.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kahneman\u2019s experiment highlights how initial impressions created by the first ad influenced the participants\u2019 perceptions of the second ad, demonstrating the role of sequence in decision-making.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While ad complexity affects perceptions, the text does not claim it is the primary basis for decision-making.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The experiment shows that the effectiveness of ads depends on their order, not that detailed ads are always more effective.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Although impressions are influential, the text does not suggest participants disregard contradictory information.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
