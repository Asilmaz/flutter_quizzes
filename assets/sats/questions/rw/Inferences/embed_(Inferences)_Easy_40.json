{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Wisdom of Wolves: Lessons from the Sawtooth Pack</em>, Jim and Jamie Dutcher document the behaviors of wolves when using tools in their environment. They describe how certain packs use sticks to dig through snow-covered areas to access buried food. This behavior was observed more frequently in regions with harsher winters, where resources are scarce and harder to locate. The Dutchers suggest that this tool-using behavior highlights the wolves\u2019 problem-solving abilities and their capacity to adapt to challenging environmental conditions. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "wolves rely primarily on tool use rather than instinct when searching for food.", "B": "tool use in wolves may be a response to specific environmental pressures, such as harsh winters.", "C": "wolves in regions with abundant resources are more likely to use tools than those in resource-scarce areas.", "D": "wolves\u2019 use of tools demonstrates a higher level of intelligence than seen in other predators.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The text emphasizes that tool use in wolves is more common in harsh winters, linking it to specific environmental pressures.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While tool use is notable, the passage does not suggest it is their primary means of locating food.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage indicates that tool use is more frequent in resource-scarce environments, not in areas with abundant resources.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While the text highlights intelligence, it does not compare wolves to other predators explicitly.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
