Throughout their journey, they encounter hostility, injustice, and exploitation, yet they persist in their quest for a better life.

Steinbeck\u2019s novel critiques the American Dream by showing how the Joads\u2019 hard work and perseverance are not enough to overcome the systemic inequalities and exploitation they face. The novel suggests that the Dream is often unattainable for those who lack power or resources, such as the working class.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. The novel shows that the American Dream is not equally accessible to everyone, particularly for disenfranchised individuals like the Joads, whose struggles are exacerbated by systemic issues.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While the Joads demonstrate resilience, the novel ultimately reveals that their efforts are insufficient in the face of systemic injustice. Hard work does not guarantee success in a society that exploits the working class.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Steinbeck critiques the economic system and its injustices, illustrating how the struggles of the working class are not due to personal failings, but rather the result of systemic inequalities.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
