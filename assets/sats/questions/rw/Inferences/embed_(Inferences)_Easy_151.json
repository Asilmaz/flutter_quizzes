{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben explores how trees communicate and support each other within a forest ecosystem. He explains that trees use underground fungal networks to exchange nutrients and send chemical signals to one another. For example, when a tree is under threat from pests, it can send warning signals to neighboring trees, which then produce protective chemicals. Wohlleben argues that this mutual support strengthens the entire forest, allowing it to thrive despite challenges. He likens the forest to a community where each tree plays an important role in maintaining the health of the whole ecosystem. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "trees in forests compete with each other for resources, leading to a breakdown in cooperation.", "B": "trees in forests rarely communicate or share resources, focusing solely on their own survival.", "C": "forests are ecosystems where trees help one another by sharing resources and protecting each other.", "D": "the survival of a forest depends on individual trees acting independently of one another.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben emphasizes that trees in forests cooperate by sharing resources and communicating to protect each other, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text suggests that trees do not compete but rather support each other, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. Wohlleben specifically discusses the ways trees communicate and share resources, making this choice false.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage underscores that cooperation is crucial for the survival of the forest, not individual, independent action.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
