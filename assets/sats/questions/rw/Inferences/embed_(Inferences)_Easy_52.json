{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert examines how climate change has contributed to species extinctions throughout history. She discusses the extinction of amphibians, highlighting the golden toad in Costa Rica, which disappeared due to a fungal disease exacerbated by rising temperatures. Kolbert explains that warming climates allowed the fungus to spread into previously uninhabitable regions, increasing its impact on vulnerable populations. She argues that this pattern illustrates how human-driven climate change not only affects individual species but also disrupts entire ecosystems, making recovery more challenging. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "rising temperatures may make some species more adaptable to their environments.", "B": "species living in warmer climates are less vulnerable to climate-related extinction events.", "C": "fungal diseases are the primary cause of extinction for most amphibian species.", "D": "human-induced climate change can accelerate the spread of diseases that threaten biodiversity.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kolbert\u2019s discussion highlights how climate change enables the spread of diseases, demonstrating its role in accelerating biodiversity loss.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text focuses on the negative impacts of rising temperatures, not on adaptability.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While fungal diseases are a significant factor, the text does not claim they are the primary cause of extinction for most amphibians.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights increased vulnerability to extinction events in warmer climates, contradicting this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
