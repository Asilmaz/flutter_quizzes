{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben explores the ways trees communicate and support each other in forest ecosystems. He describes how trees use underground fungal networks, often called the \u201cwood wide web,\u201d to share nutrients and warn nearby trees of potential threats, such as insect infestations. Wohlleben argues that this cooperation helps forests remain resilient, as stronger trees aid weaker ones to maintain overall ecological stability. He likens this to a form of community where mutual support ensures collective survival. This perspective highlights the intricate relationships within natural ecosystems that sustain biodiversity and health. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "trees in forests rarely communicate or share resources with each other.", "B": "mutual support among trees strengthens forest ecosystems and promotes resilience.", "C": "underground fungal networks have minimal impact on forest health or biodiversity.", "D": "stronger trees rarely assist weaker ones in maintaining forest stability.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben emphasizes how trees\u2019 mutual support through fungal networks strengthens ecosystems and enhances resilience, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the active communication and resource-sharing among trees, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. Fungal networks are described as crucial for maintaining forest health, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes that stronger trees aid weaker ones to maintain forest stability, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
