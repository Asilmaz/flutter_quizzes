{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert examines the anthropogenic causes behind the ongoing mass extinction of species. She describes how human activities, such as deforestation, overfishing, and carbon emissions, have disrupted ecosystems on a global scale. Kolbert highlights how rising ocean temperatures and acidification are particularly devastating to coral reefs, which serve as critical habitats for marine life. She argues that these changes not only threaten individual species but also destabilize entire ecosystems. This perspective underscores the urgent need for conservation efforts to mitigate human impact and preserve biodiversity. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "human activities have minimal impact on ecosystems or global biodiversity.", "B": "coral reefs are largely unaffected by human actions like deforestation and carbon emissions.", "C": "conservation efforts are critical to addressing human-induced threats to biodiversity.", "D": "disruptions to ecosystems have little effect on the stability of global biodiversity.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kolbert emphasizes the importance of conservation to counteract the harmful effects of human activities on biodiversity and ecosystems, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly describes the significant impact of human activities on ecosystems, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. Kolbert specifically discusses the vulnerability of coral reefs to human-induced changes, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text underscores how disruptions to ecosystems destabilize biodiversity, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
