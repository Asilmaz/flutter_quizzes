{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Edward O. Wilson examines how biodiversity is affected by environmental changes. He highlights a study on rainforest ecosystems, where deforestation led to a dramatic decline in species diversity. Wilson explains that clearing forests fragments habitats, isolating populations and reducing their chances of survival. He argues that protecting large, continuous habitats is essential for maintaining biodiversity and preventing ecosystem collapse. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness of species and the importance of conserving their shared environments. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "deforestation has minimal impact on biodiversity in rainforest ecosystems.", "B": "protecting small, fragmented habitats is more effective than preserving continuous ones.", "C": "isolated populations in fragmented habitats are better equipped to adapt to environmental changes.", "D": "habitat fragmentation can isolate populations and significantly reduce biodiversity.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wilson emphasizes how habitat fragmentation isolates populations, reducing biodiversity and endangering ecosystems.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text clearly states that deforestation has a severe impact on biodiversity, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights that isolation makes populations less likely to survive, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text stresses the importance of preserving large, continuous habitats over fragmented ones.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
