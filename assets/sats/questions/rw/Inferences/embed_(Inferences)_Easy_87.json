{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee explores the influence of genetic mutations on human evolution. He describes a mutation in the gene responsible for lactose digestion, which became prevalent in populations that relied on dairy farming. Mukherjee explains that this mutation allowed individuals to digest milk into adulthood, providing a nutritional advantage in environments where other food sources were scarce. He argues that natural selection often favors mutations that provide immediate survival benefits, even if they arise in response to specific cultural practices. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic mutations rarely provide survival advantages to human populations.", "B": "cultural practices can influence the spread of genetic mutations through natural selection.", "C": "lactose digestion is an innate ability in all human populations, unrelated to genetic mutations.", "D": "mutations that offer survival advantages typically disappear over generations.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee highlights how cultural practices, like dairy farming, influenced the spread of genetic mutations that provided survival benefits, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes that mutations like the one for lactose digestion do provide significant survival advantages.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text specifically attributes lactose digestion to a genetic mutation, refuting the claim that it is innate in all humans.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage suggests that beneficial mutations, like the one for lactose digestion, persist due to their advantages.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
