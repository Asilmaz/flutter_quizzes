{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Into the Wild</em>, Jon Krakauer recounts the story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who leaves behind his comfortable life to venture into the Alaskan wilderness in search of a deeper meaning to life. McCandless rejects the conventional lifestyle of wealth and social status in favor of a life of simplicity and self-reliance. However, Krakauer's narrative reveals the tragic consequences of McCandless's journey, as he ultimately dies alone in the wild, having failed to adequately prepare for the harsh realities of nature. Through McCandless\u2019s story, Krakauer raises questions about the balance between idealism and reality, suggesting that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "the search for a simpler, more authentic life is always doomed to failure, as nature is too unforgiving.", "B": "living off the land without preparation is the ideal way to experience freedom, and McCandless\u2019s story proves that it is the only path to true fulfillment.", "C": "rejecting societal norms in pursuit of personal freedom can lead to dangerous consequences when not tempered by practical knowledge and preparation.", "D": "following a path of idealism without understanding the consequences can lead to a happy, fulfilling life, as long as one remains optimistic.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Krakauer's portrayal of McCandless suggests that while the search for personal freedom and simplicity is noble, it requires practical knowledge and preparation to avoid tragic consequences.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While McCandless's journey ends tragically, the narrative does not suggest that the pursuit of a simpler life is always doomed, only that it requires careful planning and balance with reality.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. McCandless\u2019s failure to prepare properly for his journey contradicts the idea that living off the land is always the ideal path to freedom or fulfillment.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. McCandless's tragic end shows that idealism alone, without practical knowledge and preparation, is insufficient for survival, disproving this option.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
