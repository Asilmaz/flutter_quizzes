{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Remarkable Creatures</em>, Sean B. Carroll discusses how scientists use fossil evidence to understand the appearance and behavior of extinct species. He describes a study where paleontologists discovered fossilized skin impressions of a dinosaur, revealing the presence of scales and feather-like structures. By analyzing the arrangement and composition of these structures, researchers inferred the dinosaur\u2019s likely coloration and patterns. Carroll argues that advances in fossil analysis techniques have allowed scientists to make increasingly accurate reconstructions of long-extinct species. This discovery suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "paleontologists can deduce the coloration of extinct animals by studying preserved skin structures.", "B": "fossilized skin impressions are more reliable than skeletal fossils for understanding extinct species.", "C": "scales and feathers on dinosaurs indicate that they were less diverse than previously thought.", "D": "fossil evidence alone cannot provide any meaningful insight into the appearance of extinct species.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The passage explains how fossilized skin impressions and feather structures helped researchers deduce the dinosaur\u2019s coloration and patterns, demonstrating their utility in reconstruction.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While skin impressions offer specific insights, the text does not claim they are more reliable than skeletal fossils overall.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes diversity in features, not a lack of it.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly highlights how fossil evidence provides meaningful insights into extinct species\u2019 appearances.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
