Eyal emphasizes the importance of emotional and habitual triggers, rather than functionality alone, in driving engagement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While the text discusses the role of notifications, it does not suggest they discourage interaction; rather, they are part of the engagement strategy.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
