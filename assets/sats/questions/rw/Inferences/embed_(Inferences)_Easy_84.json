{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert explores the role of human activity in driving species extinctions. She highlights the case of amphibians, particularly the golden toad, which vanished due to a fungal disease spread by human activity. Kolbert explains that global trade and rising temperatures allowed the fungus to spread to new regions, decimating populations of vulnerable species. She argues that human-induced environmental changes often exacerbate natural threats, accelerating the pace of extinction and destabilizing ecosystems. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "human-induced environmental changes can amplify natural threats to species survival.", "B": "human activity often mitigates natural threats, reducing extinction risks.", "C": "amphibians are less vulnerable to extinction than other species affected by climate change.", "D": "fungal diseases are the primary cause of extinction for all amphibians.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kolbert emphasizes how human actions, such as global trade and temperature increases, worsen natural threats like fungal diseases, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text focuses on how human activity exacerbates natural threats, not mitigates them.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage discusses the specific vulnerability of amphibians to extinction, not their resilience.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While fungal diseases are significant, the text does not generalize them as the sole cause of extinction for all amphibians.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
