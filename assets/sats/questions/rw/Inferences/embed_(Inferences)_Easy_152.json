{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee explores the complexity of genetic mutations and their role in human evolution. He discusses the case of a mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, a serious genetic disorder. Despite its harmful effects, this mutation persists in populations because it offers some protection against other diseases, such as cholera. Mukherjee argues that evolution often involves trade-offs, where mutations provide advantages in one context but have negative consequences in others. This idea challenges the simplistic notion that mutations are either entirely good or entirely bad. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic mutations are always beneficial and rarely have any harmful effects.", "B": "cystic fibrosis has no impact on genetic diversity or survival in human populations.", "C": "mutations that provide benefits in some contexts can also have harmful consequences in others.", "D": "genetic mutations are only passed on if they provide clear, long-term benefits with no drawbacks.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee discusses how genetic mutations can have both positive and negative effects, depending on the environmental context, which supports this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights that mutations can have both harmful and beneficial effects, refuting the idea that mutations are always beneficial.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text emphasizes the persistence of the cystic fibrosis mutation due to its protective effect, making this choice false.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Mukherjee argues that mutations may have drawbacks while still being passed on, directly contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
