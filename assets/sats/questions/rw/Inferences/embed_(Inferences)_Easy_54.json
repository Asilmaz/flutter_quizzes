{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Edward O. Wilson examines how isolation drives species evolution. He describes how animals on islands often develop unique traits not found in their mainland counterparts, a phenomenon known as island gigantism or dwarfism. Wilson highlights the case of the Komodo dragon, the largest living lizard, which evolved on isolated Indonesian islands. He explains that limited predators and specific environmental pressures allowed this species to grow larger than other reptiles. Wilson argues that studying isolated ecosystems provides valuable insights into how environmental factors influence evolutionary paths. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "species in isolated ecosystems are less likely to develop unique adaptations.", "B": "environmental pressures in isolated ecosystems can lead to the development of unique physical traits.", "C": "island ecosystems prevent species from reaching their full evolutionary potential.", "D": "evolutionary traits in isolated species are primarily shaped by interactions with mainland populations.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wilson emphasizes how isolation and environmental pressures result in unique traits, such as the large size of the Komodo dragon, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights the opposite, showing that isolation fosters unique adaptations.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage suggests that island ecosystems enhance evolutionary development rather than limit it.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text discusses isolated species adapting independently of mainland interactions, contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
