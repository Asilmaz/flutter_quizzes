{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben explores the survival strategies of trees in harsh environments. He describes a species of pine tree that thrives in arid climates by growing extremely deep roots to access underground water reserves. Wohlleben explains that these trees often grow far apart, reducing competition for limited resources. He also notes that the trees use their deep roots not only for water but also to anchor themselves against strong desert winds. This adaptation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "certain tree species can adapt their root systems to meet the specific challenges of their environment.", "B": "deep root systems help trees in arid climates survive by minimizing competition for sunlight.", "C": "trees in arid climates are unable to grow in close proximity due to poor soil quality.", "D": "trees with deep roots are less likely to thrive in regions with strong winds or high temperatures.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice C</strong> is the best answer. The passage highlights the role of deep roots in accessing water and withstanding wind, showing how trees adapt their root systems to environmental challenges.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text attributes the wide spacing of trees to reduced resource competition, not soil quality.<strong>Choice B</strong> is incorrect. The text focuses on water access and wind resistance, not sunlight competition.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage indicates that deep roots help the trees thrive in harsh conditions, including strong winds, rather than hindering their survival.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
