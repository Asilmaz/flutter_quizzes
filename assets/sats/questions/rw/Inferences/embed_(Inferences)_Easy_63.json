{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World</em>, Steve Brusatte discusses how fossilized footprints reveal details about dinosaur behavior. He describes a discovery of parallel tracks from a herd of herbivorous dinosaurs, which suggests coordinated movement. Brusatte notes that the consistent spacing between the tracks indicates that the dinosaurs moved together, likely for protection against predators. He argues that such fossil evidence provides insight into the social structures and survival strategies of prehistoric species, showing that dinosaurs exhibited behaviors similar to modern herd animals. This evidence suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "fossilized tracks offer valuable insights into the social behavior of prehistoric animals.", "B": "herbivorous dinosaurs were more solitary than previously believed.", "C": "coordinated movement in dinosaurs was limited to predatory species.", "D": "herd behavior in dinosaurs was ineffective for avoiding predators.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Brusatte highlights how fossilized tracks reveal the social and survival strategies of dinosaurs, supporting the conclusion that such evidence provides key insights.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The tracks indicate coordinated movement, which contradicts the idea of solitary behavior.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage focuses on herbivorous dinosaurs, not predatory species, as exhibiting coordinated movement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text suggests that herd behavior was a strategy for avoiding predators, not that it was ineffective.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
