{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World</em>, Andrea Wulf explores the 19th-century naturalist Alexander von Humboldt\u2019s observations on interconnected ecosystems. Wulf describes how Humboldt noted that when forests were cleared, the loss of tree roots led to soil erosion and changes in local water systems. He argued that deforestation disrupted not only the immediate environment but also surrounding regions by altering rainfall patterns. Humboldt\u2019s work emphasized the fragile balance between natural systems and human activity, highlighting the long-term consequences of environmental changes. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "deforestation impacts only the areas where trees are removed, not broader ecosystems.", "B": "human activity often disrupts ecosystems in ways that extend beyond the immediate environment.", "C": "forests primarily benefit ecosystems by preventing soil erosion, rather than by influencing water systems.", "D": "ecosystems can quickly recover from human interference without significant long-term effects.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The text explains how deforestation leads to broader environmental disruptions, supporting the idea that human activity has far-reaching effects.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that deforestation impacts surrounding regions, not just the cleared areas.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While preventing soil erosion is one benefit of forests, the text emphasizes their role in maintaining water systems as well.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Humboldt\u2019s observations underline the long-term consequences of environmental changes, contradicting the idea of quick recovery.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
