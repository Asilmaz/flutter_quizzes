{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em>, Walter Isaacson examines the collaborative nature of technological breakthroughs. He recounts the development of the first computer, which involved a diverse team of engineers and mathematicians. Isaacson argues that no single individual can claim full credit for the invention, as each member contributed unique expertise, from hardware design to programming. He emphasizes that the ability to integrate multiple skill sets and perspectives is what drives innovation. This observation highlights the importance of teamwork in solving complex problems and achieving groundbreaking advancements. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise is essential for driving innovation and solving complex problems.", "B": "major technological breakthroughs are typically the result of individual brilliance rather than teamwork.", "C": "individual contributions rarely play a significant role in collaborative technological projects.", "D": "technological progress is best achieved when teams focus solely on hardware or programming.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Isaacson emphasizes that innovation results from the integration of diverse expertise, demonstrating the importance of collaboration in achieving technological breakthroughs.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage specifically refutes the idea that individual brilliance alone drives progress, highlighting the role of teamwork instead.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While the text emphasizes teamwork, it also acknowledges the value of individual contributions within the team.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Isaacson highlights the need for integrating multiple disciplines, not focusing narrowly on one area, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
