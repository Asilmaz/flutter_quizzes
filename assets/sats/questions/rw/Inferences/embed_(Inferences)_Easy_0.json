{"introduction": "", "text": "In their book <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben and Tim Flannery discuss how trees in forests form extensive underground networks of roots and fungi to share resources, a phenomenon often referred to as the wood wide web. Through these networks, trees can transfer water, nutrients, and even chemical signals to one another. The authors describe an experiment in which scientists observed a dying tree sharing its remaining nutrients with nearby trees of the same species. This act benefitted the surrounding trees, even though the dying tree could not survive. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "trees in a forest rely on their underground networks to provide energy for photosynthesis.", "B": "fungal networks in forests are more beneficial to younger trees than to mature trees.", "C": "trees may exhibit behaviors that prioritize the survival of the group over individual survival.", "D": "a tree's root system is incapable of functioning without support from neighboring trees.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The passage describes how a dying tree shared nutrients with others, even though it gained no survival benefit. This suggests that trees may exhibit group-oriented behaviors rather than prioritizing individual survival.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While the passage discusses nutrient sharing, it does not suggest that underground networks directly contribute to energy production via photosynthesis.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not indicate that fungal networks are more beneficial to younger trees; it focuses on a dying tree aiding others, regardless of age.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights collaboration but does not imply that a tree's root system cannot function independently.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
