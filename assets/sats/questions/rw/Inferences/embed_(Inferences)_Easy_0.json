	"text": "Scientists studying coral reefs note that some coral species exchange chemical signals with reef fish, prompting the fish to remove harmful algae. However, an extensive survey of reef systems shows that not all coral species produce these signals. These findings indicate that ______.",
	"question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
	"A": "all reef fish rely on chemical cues for their survival and reproduction.",
	"B": "coral species incapable of producing chemical signals were once able to do so but lost the trait over time.",
	"C": "chemical signaling between coral and fish may be only one among several mechanisms that maintain reef health.",
	"D": "harmful algae are more likely to dominate in coral reefs that host many different fish species.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "<strong>Choice C</strong> is the best answer. The passage states that some coral species use chemical signals to attract fish for algae removal but notes that other coral species do not, suggesting multiple processes sustain reef health. <br><strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect because there is no indication that such signals are the sole survival factor for fish. <strong>Choice B</strong> lacks evidence. <strong>Choice D</strong> does not follow from the survey findings.<h3>Question Difficulty: Hard</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"
