{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less</em>, Barry Schwartz examines how having too many options can affect decision-making. He describes an experiment in which participants were presented with two tables of products: one offering 24 types of jam and another offering only 6. While more people stopped at the table with 24 options, they were less likely to make a purchase compared to those who visited the table with 6 options. Schwartz argues that having too many choices can overwhelm consumers, making it harder for them to commit to a decision. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "consumers are more likely to make purchases when they perceive a product to be of high quality.", "B": "limiting the number of options available may increase consumer satisfaction and purchasing behavior.", "C": "offering a wide variety of products is the most effective way to attract consumer attention.", "D": "consumers tend to be equally satisfied regardless of the number of options they are presented with.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The experiment shows that fewer options led to more purchases, supporting the idea that limiting choices can improve decision-making and satisfaction.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text focuses on the effect of choice overload, not product quality, on consumer behavior.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. While a wide variety attracted more attention, it did not result in more purchases, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The experiment demonstrates a clear difference in consumer behavior based on the number of options, invalidating this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
