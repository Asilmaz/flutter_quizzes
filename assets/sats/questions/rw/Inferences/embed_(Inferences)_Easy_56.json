{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman explores the advanced cognitive abilities of birds, focusing on their use of tools. She describes an experiment in which New Caledonian crows were observed crafting hooked tools from twigs to extract insects from tree bark. Ackerman explains that the crows not only shaped tools but also adapted their designs based on the challenges they faced, demonstrating problem-solving and planning skills. She argues that these behaviors highlight an intelligence level comparable to that of some primates. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "birds with advanced tool-making skills often rely on instinct rather than learned behavior.", "B": "New Caledonian crows exhibit problem-solving abilities that rival those of some primates.", "C": "tool-making in birds is more advanced than similar behaviors observed in primates.", "D": "crows use tools primarily to compete with other species for food resources.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Ackerman emphasizes the crows\u2019 ability to adapt and design tools, comparing their problem-solving skills to those of primates.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights learned behavior and adaptability, not reliance on instinct.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text does not claim that bird tool-making surpasses primates\u2019 abilities but rather draws a comparison.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While tool use is mentioned, the text does not suggest that it is primarily for competition with other species.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
