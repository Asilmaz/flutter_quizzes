{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert examines the role of climate change in accelerating species extinctions. She discusses how rising ocean temperatures and acidification disrupt coral reefs, ecosystems that support a vast array of marine life. Kolbert describes studies revealing that the loss of coral reefs creates cascading effects, endangering fish populations and destabilizing marine food chains. She argues that human-induced climate change has become a primary driver of ecosystem collapse, threatening biodiversity on a global scale. This observation underscores the importance of addressing environmental issues to preserve ecological balance and species survival. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "human activity has little to no impact on marine ecosystems or global biodiversity.", "B": "human-induced climate change can destabilize ecosystems and threaten species survival.", "C": "coral reefs are unaffected by rising temperatures and ocean acidification.", "D": "biodiversity in marine ecosystems is largely independent of coral reef health.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kolbert emphasizes that human-induced climate change disrupts ecosystems, endangers species, and threatens biodiversity, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text clearly highlights the significant impact of human activity on marine ecosystems and biodiversity, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage explicitly discusses how coral reefs are negatively affected by rising temperatures and acidification.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Kolbert shows that coral reef health is vital to maintaining marine biodiversity, contradicting this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
