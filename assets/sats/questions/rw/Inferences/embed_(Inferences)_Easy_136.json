{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman explores the remarkable cognitive abilities of birds, focusing on their problem-solving skills. She describes an experiment with European starlings, where they had to manipulate a series of levers and strings to access food. The starlings demonstrated the ability to analyze the mechanics of the setup, adapt their behavior when faced with new challenges, and solve the task efficiently. Ackerman argues that these behaviors suggest a level of intelligence and adaptability previously underestimated in avian species. This perspective highlights how environmental challenges drive the development of advanced cognitive skills in birds. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "environmental challenges encourage the development of advanced cognitive skills in birds.", "B": "problem-solving abilities in birds are limited to instinct and lack adaptability.", "C": "birds\u2019 cognitive abilities are unrelated to problem-solving or adaptability.", "D": "experiments like these show that birds rarely succeed in solving complex tasks.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Ackerman emphasizes that environmental challenges encourage the development of advanced cognitive skills, as demonstrated by the starlings in the experiment.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights that birds are capable of adaptive problem-solving, refuting the idea that their abilities are instinctive and unchanging.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The experiment explicitly links birds\u2019 cognitive abilities to problem-solving and adaptability, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The starlings\u2019 success in solving the task demonstrates their problem-solving skills, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
