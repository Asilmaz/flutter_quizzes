{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World</em>, Steve Brusatte explores the traits that enabled dinosaurs to adapt and thrive in diverse environments. He describes how some theropods, like <em>Velociraptor</em>, evolved feathers that initially served as insulation but later supported flight in their descendants. Brusatte argues that such adaptations often began with small, functional changes that provided survival advantages in specific conditions. Over time, these traits evolved into more complex forms that allowed species to exploit new ecological niches. This perspective highlights how incremental changes can lead to transformative evolutionary developments. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "small functional changes in species rarely lead to significant evolutionary advantages.", "B": "traits like feathers evolved solely to support flight in theropods without other functions.", "C": "incremental adaptations often provide survival benefits and pave the way for major evolutionary shifts.", "D": "evolutionary developments in dinosaurs were limited to isolated instances and had no long-term impact.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Brusatte emphasizes how small changes, such as the evolution of feathers, led to significant survival advantages and major evolutionary shifts, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage illustrates that small changes played a crucial role in species\u2019 survival and evolution, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. Feathers initially evolved for insulation, not solely for flight, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights the long-term impact of evolutionary developments in dinosaurs, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
