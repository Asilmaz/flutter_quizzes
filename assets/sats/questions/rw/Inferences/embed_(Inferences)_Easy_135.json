{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee explores the role of genetic mutations in human evolution. He describes the mutation responsible for sickle cell anemia, which, despite its health risks, provides resistance to malaria in carriers. Mukherjee explains that this mutation has persisted in populations where malaria is prevalent because of its survival advantage. He argues that genetic traits shaped by environmental pressures often reflect a balance between benefits and costs. This perspective highlights the complex interplay between genetics and adaptation to specific ecological challenges. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic mutations always offer either exclusively positive or negative effects on survival.", "B": "resistance to diseases like malaria is unrelated to genetic mutations in specific populations.", "C": "mutations like the one causing sickle cell anemia rarely persist in populations over time.", "D": "genetic traits shaped by environmental pressures often involve trade-offs between benefits and risks.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee discusses how genetic traits like the sickle cell mutation persist because they offer survival advantages despite associated risks, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights that genetic mutations can involve trade-offs, refuting the idea of exclusively positive or negative effects.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage demonstrates that mutations like the sickle cell trait persist because of their survival benefits, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Mukherjee explicitly links genetic mutations to resistance against diseases like malaria, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
