{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle</em>, Thor Hanson explores how feathered dinosaurs evolved into modern birds. He describes how scientists analyzed fossilized feathers to determine their structure and function. By examining melanosomes\u2014organelles responsible for pigmentation\u2014researchers discovered that the shapes of these structures could reveal the colors of prehistoric birds. Hanson notes that certain color patterns, such as stripes or spots, may have provided camouflage or signaling advantages. This discovery demonstrates how detailed fossil analysis can shed light on the behavior and appearance of extinct species. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "melanosomes are the only way to infer the colors of extinct animals.", "B": "scientists can determine an extinct bird\u2019s color patterns by analyzing the shape of its melanosomes.", "C": "the fossilization process preserves feathers better than other parts of an animal\u2019s body.", "D": "prehistoric birds with intricate color patterns were more likely to survive than those without.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The text specifically discusses how the shape of melanosomes in fossilized feathers allows scientists to infer the colors and patterns of extinct birds.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While melanosomes are a key tool, the text does not suggest they are the only method for inferring color.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text does not compare the preservation of feathers to other body parts.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Although color patterns may have had advantages, the text does not claim they were a definitive survival factor.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
