{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>, Jared Diamond explores the development of early human societies and their use of resources. He describes how Bronze Age civilizations used rare metals like tin and copper to create bronze tools and weapons. However, Diamond notes that when sources of these metals became scarce or inaccessible, civilizations adapted by developing iron tools, which were more abundant and durable. This shift marked the beginning of the Iron Age, a period of significant technological and societal advancement. Diamond argues that changes in resource availability often drive innovation. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "the scarcity of certain resources can push civilizations to adopt new materials and technologies.", "B": "societies that rely on abundant resources are less likely to innovate than those facing scarcity.", "C": "civilizations with access to tin and copper always advanced more quickly than those without access.", "D": "resource limitations often cause civilizations to collapse rather than adapt to new challenges.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Diamond emphasizes how resource scarcity prompted the development of iron tools, illustrating how necessity drives innovation.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While scarcity drove innovation in this case, the text does not generalize about societies relying on abundant resources.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights adaptation, not a consistent advantage for civilizations with specific resources.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text focuses on adaptation rather than collapse in response to resource limitations.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
