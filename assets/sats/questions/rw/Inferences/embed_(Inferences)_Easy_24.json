{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Genius of Birds</em>, Jennifer Ackerman investigates the extraordinary intelligence of birds, focusing on their tool-making abilities. She describes an experiment with Goffin\u2019s cockatoos, which were observed bending wires to create hooks to retrieve food from narrow containers. This behavior, previously thought to be unique to primates, demonstrated an advanced understanding of problem-solving and planning. Ackerman notes that the cockatoos retained the tools they created for future use, suggesting an awareness of the tools\u2019 value. She argues that such behaviors reveal a level of cognitive complexity not traditionally attributed to birds. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "Goffin\u2019s cockatoos are less likely than primates to use tools in the wild.", "B": "birds capable of creating tools may exhibit higher levels of foresight and intelligence.", "C": "tool-making in birds is a learned behavior that requires extensive training by researchers.", "D": "retaining tools for future use is a behavior unique to cockatoos and not seen in other species.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The passage highlights the cockatoos\u2019 ability to create and retain tools, suggesting advanced foresight and intelligence.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text does not compare tool use in cockatoos and primates in the wild, focusing only on the experiment.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not mention that tool-making in cockatoos requires extensive training by researchers.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While the cockatoos retained tools, the text does not suggest this behavior is unique to them.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
