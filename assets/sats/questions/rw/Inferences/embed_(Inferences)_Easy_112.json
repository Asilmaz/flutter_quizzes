{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben explores how trees in forests form complex networks to share resources. He describes how older, more established trees use underground fungal networks to distribute water and nutrients to saplings struggling in shaded areas. Wohlleben compares this cooperation to a social support system, arguing that forests thrive because of interconnectedness and mutual aid among trees. He emphasizes that this resource-sharing strengthens the forest as a whole, promoting resilience in the face of environmental challenges. This finding underscores the importance of collaboration in maintaining ecological balance and stability. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "forests rely solely on individual trees for survival, with minimal resource-sharing.", "B": "younger trees are entirely independent of older trees for survival in shaded areas.", "C": "resource-sharing among trees enhances forest health and resilience to environmental challenges.", "D": "underground fungal networks play a negligible role in maintaining forest ecosystems.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben highlights the critical role of resource-sharing in promoting forest health and resilience, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes interconnectedness and resource-sharing, refuting the claim that forests rely on individual trees.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text shows that younger trees benefit significantly from the support of older trees, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Wohlleben describes fungal networks as integral to forest ecosystems, refuting the claim that they are negligible.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
