{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, Elizabeth Kolbert investigates how human activities accelerate species extinction. She describes the impact of deforestation, pollution, and climate change on biodiversity, highlighting coral reefs as particularly vulnerable ecosystems. Kolbert explains that rising ocean temperatures and acidification are destroying coral reefs, which support diverse marine life. She argues that the loss of these ecosystems leads to cascading effects, disrupting food chains and threatening the survival of numerous species. This perspective underscores the need for urgent conservation efforts to mitigate human impact on the environment. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "human activities have little impact on marine ecosystems or global biodiversity.", "B": "coral reefs are unaffected by rising temperatures or ocean acidification.", "C": "protecting vulnerable ecosystems like coral reefs is critical to maintaining biodiversity.", "D": "food chains remain stable regardless of damage to critical ecosystems like coral reefs.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Kolbert emphasizes the importance of protecting ecosystems like coral reefs to maintain biodiversity and prevent cascading ecological disruptions.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights the significant impact of human activities on ecosystems, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. Kolbert describes how coral reefs are heavily impacted by climate change and acidification, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text shows that damage to coral reefs disrupts food chains, contradicting this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
