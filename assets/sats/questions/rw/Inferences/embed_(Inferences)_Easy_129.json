{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</em>, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein explore how small changes in choice architecture influence behavior. They highlight an experiment where cafeteria layouts were altered to make healthier food options more accessible and visible than less healthy ones. This subtle change significantly increased the selection of healthy items without restricting individual choice. Thaler and Sunstein argue that \u201cnudges\u201d like these work by guiding decisions in beneficial directions while preserving autonomy. This observation demonstrates how small, thoughtful adjustments can lead to meaningful improvements in decision-making and outcomes. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "nudges encourage better decisions without limiting personal freedom by subtly altering environments.", "B": "changes in choice architecture rarely influence individual decisions or behavior.", "C": "individuals make healthier choices only when less healthy options are entirely removed.", "D": "guiding decisions through environmental changes is less effective than restricting available options.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Thaler and Sunstein emphasize that nudges guide decisions effectively by subtly altering the choice environment while preserving freedom, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The experiment demonstrates that choice architecture significantly influences behavior, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights that healthier choices increased without removing less healthy options, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text shows that guiding decisions through nudges is effective, even without restricting available choices, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
