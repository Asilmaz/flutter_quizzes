{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Overstory</em>, Richard Powers examines the intricate relationships between trees and their ecosystems. He describes a study in which researchers found that forests with greater tree species diversity stored more carbon and were more resilient to pests and diseases. By analyzing the interactions between different tree species, the scientists concluded that biodiversity enhances the overall health and functionality of forest ecosystems. Powers argues that protecting diverse forests is critical for combating climate change and maintaining ecological stability. This study suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "forests with fewer tree species are better suited for carbon storage due to reduced competition.", "B": "biodiversity within forests contributes to their resilience and ecological effectiveness.", "C": "tree species diversity is irrelevant to the functionality of forest ecosystems.", "D": "the primary benefit of biodiversity in forests is to reduce carbon emissions from individual trees.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. The study highlights how biodiversity strengthens forests\u2019 carbon storage and resilience, supporting the conclusion that it enhances ecological effectiveness.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage explains that diversity, not fewer species, improves forest resilience and functionality.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text directly connects tree species diversity to forest health, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. While carbon storage is mentioned, the primary focus is on biodiversity\u2019s role in resilience and ecosystem health, not reducing emissions.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
