{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben examines the complex social networks that trees form within forests. He describes how trees use underground fungal networks to share nutrients and water, particularly with younger or weaker trees that struggle to survive. Wohlleben notes that this behavior, often referred to as the wood wide web, demonstrates cooperation within a species that benefits the entire ecosystem. He argues that these interactions suggest a form of communal behavior, where the survival of one tree can directly support the health of the forest. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "fungal networks in forests enable trees to cooperate for mutual survival and ecosystem health.", "B": "trees with weaker root systems are less likely to benefit from underground networks.", "C": "trees primarily compete for resources through underground fungal networks, reducing ecosystem stability.", "D": "nutrient-sharing behaviors are limited to older trees and exclude younger, weaker ones.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben emphasizes how fungal networks enable trees to share resources, demonstrating cooperation that benefits the forest ecosystem.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights that weaker trees benefit from these networks, contradicting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage focuses on cooperation, not competition, facilitated by fungal networks.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text specifically mentions that younger, weaker trees receive support, refuting this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
