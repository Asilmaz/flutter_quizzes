{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben explores the cooperative behavior of trees in forest ecosystems. He explains how older trees, through underground fungal networks, share water and nutrients with smaller, younger trees struggling to grow in low-light conditions. Wohlleben likens this behavior to a social network, emphasizing that forests thrive because of interdependence rather than competition. He argues that this resource-sharing helps stabilize the ecosystem, allowing it to better withstand environmental stressors. This perspective highlights the importance of mutual support and interconnectedness in maintaining ecological health. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "resource-sharing among trees helps stabilize ecosystems and ensures their long-term health.", "B": "forests thrive primarily through competition among trees for limited resources.", "C": "fungal networks in forests play a negligible role in maintaining ecological stability.", "D": "older trees prioritize their own survival over aiding younger trees.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben emphasizes how resource-sharing through fungal networks promotes stability and resilience in forest ecosystems, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage highlights cooperation, not competition, as the key to forest health, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text describes fungal networks as integral to resource-sharing and ecological stability, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Wohlleben specifically notes that older trees support younger ones, refuting the idea that they prioritize only their own survival.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
