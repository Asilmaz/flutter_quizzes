{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben explores how trees in forests communicate and cooperate with each other. He explains that older trees use underground fungal networks to share nutrients and water with younger trees, helping them survive in low-light conditions. Wohlleben describes how this mutual support benefits the entire forest ecosystem by promoting stability and resilience. He argues that trees do not compete with one another but instead function like a community, where the health of one tree can affect the well-being of the whole forest. This perspective challenges the traditional view of forests as places of fierce competition among individual trees. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "forests are places where individual trees constantly compete for resources without cooperation.", "B": "fungal networks have little effect on the overall health and stability of forests.", "C": "younger trees in forests are completely independent of older trees for survival.", "D": "trees in forests often cooperate and share resources, leading to greater ecosystem stability.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben highlights how trees cooperate and share resources, which helps maintain the stability and health of the forest ecosystem, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The passage argues against the view that forests are places of competition, instead describing cooperation among trees.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The text clearly shows that younger trees benefit from the support of older trees, making them not fully independent.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Wohlleben stresses the importance of fungal networks in promoting forest health and stability, contradicting this statement.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
