{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World</em>, Steve Brusatte explores the adaptations that allowed dinosaurs to dominate their ecosystems. He describes how fossilized bone structures reveal that many species of dinosaurs developed hollow bones, which reduced their body weight and enabled efficient movement. Brusatte highlights the connection between these features and the evolution of flight in avian dinosaurs, illustrating how such adaptations contributed to their survival and success. He argues that evolutionary innovations often arise from environmental pressures that favor specific traits over time. This evidence suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "evolutionary adaptations, such as hollow bones, often emerge in response to environmental challenges.", "B": "dinosaurs with hollow bones were less likely to survive than those with solid bone structures.", "C": "environmental pressures rarely play a significant role in shaping evolutionary traits.", "D": "the development of flight in dinosaurs was unrelated to their skeletal adaptations.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Brusatte emphasizes how environmental pressures led to specific adaptations, like hollow bones, which contributed to the evolution of flight and survival.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text highlights the survival advantage of hollow bones, refuting the claim that they reduced survival likelihood.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage directly connects environmental pressures to evolutionary adaptations, contradicting this statement.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. Brusatte specifically notes that skeletal adaptations, such as hollow bones, were integral to the evolution of flight.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
