{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben describes how trees in forests communicate through underground fungal networks. He explains that trees use these networks to share nutrients with neighboring trees, particularly with younger or weaker ones. Wohlleben compares this system to a support network, where stronger trees help sustain the overall health of the forest. He argues that this behavior demonstrates a form of cooperation within ecosystems, where trees act not as individuals but as parts of a larger, interconnected community. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "trees in forests rely solely on fungal networks for their survival.", "B": "underground fungal networks are unnecessary for maintaining healthy forests.", "C": "older trees in forests compete with younger trees for nutrients and resources.", "D": "cooperation between trees enhances the health and stability of forest ecosystems.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Wohlleben highlights how trees use fungal networks to share nutrients, supporting the idea that cooperation improves forest health and stability.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. While fungal networks are important, the text does not claim they are the sole factor in tree survival.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage emphasizes cooperation, not competition, between older and younger trees.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text demonstrates that fungal networks play a key role in maintaining forest ecosystems, refuting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
