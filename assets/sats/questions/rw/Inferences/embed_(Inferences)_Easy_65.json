{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</em>, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein examine how framing affects consumer behavior. They describe an experiment in which participants were offered two retirement savings plans: one that required active enrollment and another that enrolled employees automatically but allowed them to opt out. The plan with automatic enrollment had significantly higher participation rates, even though the opt-out process was simple. Thaler and Sunstein argue that structuring choices to reduce friction can encourage better decision-making without limiting individual freedom. This finding suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "active enrollment plans are equally effective as automatic enrollment plans in increasing participation.", "B": "automatic enrollment plans discourage individual autonomy by removing freedom of choice.", "C": "consumers are more likely to avoid participating in plans when they perceive them as restrictive.", "D": "reducing friction in decision-making processes can lead to better outcomes without removing freedom of choice.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Thaler and Sunstein highlight how simplifying decisions through automatic enrollment increased participation while preserving individual choice, supporting this conclusion.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The experiment demonstrated that automatic enrollment was significantly more effective, refuting this claim.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that participants avoided plans due to perceived restrictions; it emphasizes increased participation.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text explicitly states that individual freedom of choice was preserved in the opt-out option, contradicting this claim.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
