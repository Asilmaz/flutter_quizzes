{"introduction": "", "text": "In <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em>, Siddhartha Mukherjee explores how genetic mutations drive evolution and adaptation. He discusses the case of sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition that alters the shape of red blood cells. Mukherjee explains that while this mutation causes health complications, it also provides resistance to malaria, offering a survival advantage in regions where the disease is prevalent. He argues that this trade-off illustrates how natural selection balances advantages and disadvantages to ensure the survival of a species. This observation suggests that ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "A": "genetic mutations are always harmful and reduce an organism's chance of survival.", "B": "organisms with genetic mutations are less likely to thrive in regions with high disease prevalence.", "C": "natural selection eliminates all harmful mutations to ensure the survival of a species.", "D": "mutations can offer survival advantages in specific environments despite their potential drawbacks.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "<strong>Choice B</strong> is the best answer. Mukherjee highlights how the sickle cell mutation, despite its drawbacks, provides a survival advantage against malaria, supporting the idea that mutations can be advantageous in certain contexts.<strong>Choice A</strong> is incorrect. The text illustrates that some mutations, like sickle cell anemia, can be beneficial in specific environments.<strong>Choice C</strong> is incorrect. The passage does not claim that natural selection eliminates all harmful mutations but rather balances them with potential advantages.<strong>Choice D</strong> is incorrect. The text demonstrates that organisms with the sickle cell mutation thrive in areas with high malaria prevalence due to the mutation\u2019s protective effect.<h3>Question Difficulty: Easy</h3><strong>Assessment</strong>: SAT Reading and Writing<br><strong>Domain</strong>: Information and Ideas<br><strong>Skill</strong>: Inferences"}
