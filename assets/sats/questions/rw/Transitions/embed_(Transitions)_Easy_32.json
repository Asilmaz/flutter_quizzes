{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley examines the consequences of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor\u2019s obsessive desire to create life leads to the creation of a creature that he immediately abandons. _____ his abandonment of the creature, Victor faces devastating consequences as the creature seeks revenge, resulting in the destruction of everyone he holds dear.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "Despite", "C": "Because of", "D": "Although", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Victor\u2019s decision to abandon the creature and the tragic outcomes he endures. The word effectively conveys the result of Victor's actions.\nA) Because of incorrectly implies that Victor\u2019s abandonment was due to the consequences, reversing the causal relationship.\nB) Despite would suggest a contrast, which does not align with the cause-and-effect dynamic in the sentence.\nD) Although implies a contradiction or exception, which does not fit the logical flow of the passage."}
