{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Jane Austen portrays Elizabeth Bennet as a sharp-witted and independent woman who values personal integrity. Elizabeth\u2019s initial prejudice against Mr. Darcy is based on her belief that he is arrogant and dismissive. _____, as Elizabeth gets to know him better and learns of his true character, she begins to reevaluate her judgment and ultimately falls in love with him.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "For example", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Elizabeth\u2019s initial judgment of Mr. Darcy and her eventual change of heart. It shows that despite her earlier feelings, she comes to understand his true nature, which leads to her falling in love with him.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Elizabeth's change of heart is simply an additional piece of information rather than a contrast to her original opinion.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which does not reflect the passage's focus on Elizabeth's evolving perspective rather than a straightforward consequence.\nD) For example would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s changing feelings are an illustration of a broader idea, but the passage is specifically focused on the contrast between her early judgment and later realization."}
