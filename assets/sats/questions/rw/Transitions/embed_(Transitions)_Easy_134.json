{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Oscar Wilde explores the corrupting influence of vanity and the pursuit of pleasure through the character of Dorian Gray. Dorian's portrait serves as a reflection of his inner self, aging and deteriorating as he indulges in a life of excess. _____, despite the outward appearance of youth and beauty, Dorian's soul becomes increasingly corrupted, and he finds himself trapped by his own actions.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" shows a direct cause-and-effect relationship between Dorian\u2019s indulgence in excess and the deterioration of his soul. The portrait reflects the internal corruption caused by his choices, which ultimately leads to his downfall.\nA) In addition would suggest that Dorian\u2019s inner corruption is simply an added point to his outward beauty, but the passage is focused on the relationship between the two and the negative consequences.\nC) Nevertheless would incorrectly imply a contradiction between Dorian\u2019s external beauty and his inner corruption, while the passage is focusing on the inevitable result of his actions.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is giving an illustration, but the passage is about the consequences of Dorian\u2019s choices, not an example of a broader concept."}
