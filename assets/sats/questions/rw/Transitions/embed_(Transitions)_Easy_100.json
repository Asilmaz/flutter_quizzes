{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, Mark Twain critiques the social and moral structures of society through the character of Huck. Huck initially feels conflicted about helping Jim, a runaway slave, due to the values he has been taught. _____, as he spends more time with Jim and witnesses his humanity, Huck begins to question these societal norms and ultimately decides to prioritize their friendship over the racial prejudices he has been taught.", "A": "In addition", "B": "However", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "As a result", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Huck\u2019s initial societal beliefs and his growing recognition of Jim's humanity. It emphasizes the shift in Huck\u2019s thinking as he moves from a place of conflict to one of moral clarity.\nA) In addition would suggest that Huck\u2019s moral growth is an additive development, which does not capture the contrast between his initial beliefs and later realizations.\nB) As a result would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which oversimplifies the more gradual and complex transformation Huck undergoes.\nC) Nevertheless would suggest a contradiction between Huck\u2019s feelings and actions, but the passage emphasizes Huck\u2019s evolving understanding rather than a stark opposition."}
