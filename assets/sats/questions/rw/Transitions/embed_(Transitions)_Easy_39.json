{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, Mark Twain explores themes of freedom and morality through Huck\u2019s journey on the Mississippi River with Jim, a runaway slave. Huck initially struggles with the societal belief that helping Jim is wrong and feels conflicted about his actions. _____, as their journey continues, Huck begins to trust his own judgment and chooses to protect Jim, even if it means rejecting the values he was taught.", "A": "As a result", "B": "Consequently", "C": "However", "D": "Despite this", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Huck\u2019s initial moral conflict and his eventual decision to trust his own beliefs. The word effectively highlights Huck\u2019s growing independence from societal norms as he chooses to help Jim.\nA) As a result would incorrectly suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between Huck\u2019s conflict and his ultimate decision, which oversimplifies the nuanced progression of his moral growth.\nC) Consequently similarly implies direct causality, which does not align with the intended contrast.\nD) Despite this might seem tempting but does not fit as smoothly because the sentence describes a shift rather than an opposition within Huck\u2019s character."}
