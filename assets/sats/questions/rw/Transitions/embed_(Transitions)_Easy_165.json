{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley explores the theme of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor becomes obsessed with creating life and seeks to conquer death itself, believing that his intellect will allow him to transcend natural limits. _____, when his creation turns out to be monstrous, Victor is horrified and immediately rejects it, leading to tragic consequences for both him and his creature.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "For example", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Victor's lofty ambitions and the disastrous outcome of his actions. It emphasizes that despite his grand ideas, the actual result is something he finds horrifying, which marks a pivotal moment of contradiction in the narrative.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Victor's rejection of the creature is just another added detail, but the passage is highlighting a significant shift from his initial ambition to his rejection of the creature.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is more about the contrast between Victor\u2019s expectations and the reality of his creation.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Victor's reaction is simply an illustration, but the passage is focused on his emotional shift and its implications."}
