It highlights the shift from Dorian\u2019s external beauty to the internal consequences of his hedonistic lifestyle.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Dorian\u2019s moral decline is an additional aspect, while the passage emphasizes the contrast between his outward appearance and the hidden reality of his character.\nB) Therefore would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is more about the contrast between Dorian\u2019s actions and their eventual repercussions.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is providing an example, but it is describing a shift in Dorian\u2019s character."}
