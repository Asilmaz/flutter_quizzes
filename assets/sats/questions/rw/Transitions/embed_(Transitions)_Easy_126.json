{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley examines the dangers of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein, who becomes obsessed with creating life. Driven by his desire to surpass natural boundaries, he eventually succeeds in reanimating a dead body. _____, upon seeing his creation, Victor is horrified by the creature\u2019s appearance and rejects it, leading to the creature's isolation and anger.", "A": "In contrast", "B": "For example", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "As a result", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship between Victor's rejection of the creature and the creature\u2019s subsequent isolation and anger. It shows that the creature\u2019s negative reaction is a direct consequence of Victor\u2019s actions.\nA) In contrast would incorrectly suggest a direct opposition between Victor\u2019s creation and his reaction, but the passage focuses on the consequences of his rejection, not a stark contrast.\nC) Nevertheless would imply a contradiction between Victor\u2019s feelings and actions, but the passage does not suggest an internal conflict\u2014it is more about the consequence of his rejection.\nD) For example would suggest that Victor\u2019s reaction is illustrating a broader point, but the passage is about the direct consequence of his decision to reject the creature."}
