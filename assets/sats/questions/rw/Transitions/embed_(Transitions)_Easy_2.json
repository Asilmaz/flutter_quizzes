	"text": "Modern robotics often relies on sensor-based feedback to ensure precise movement and positioning. Researchers at MIT have developed robots that can fine-tune their grip in real time using advanced tactile sensors. _____ even the most delicate objects can be handled without damage.",
	"A": "In other words",
	"B": "Consequently",
	"C": "Conversely",
	"D": "Nonetheless",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Correct choice B: \"Consequently.\" Because of the real-time adjustments provided by the sensors, the robots can handle delicate objects safelyâ€”this is a cause-and-effect relationship. \"In other words\" simply restates something. \"Conversely\" signals an opposite idea, and \"Nonetheless\" signals a concession or contrast."
