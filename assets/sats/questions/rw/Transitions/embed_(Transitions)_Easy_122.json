{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, Fyodor Dostoevsky explores the psychological effects of guilt and moral conflict through the character of Rodion Raskolnikov. After committing murder, Raskolnikov tries to justify his actions, believing that he is superior to others and can act outside of moral boundaries. _____, as he experiences intense guilt and paranoia, he begins to unravel mentally and emotionally, realizing that no one is exempt from the consequences of their actions.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "For example", "D": "Consequently", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Raskolnikov\u2019s crime and his ensuing mental and emotional deterioration. It shows that his attempt to justify the murder leads directly to his guilt and unraveling.\nA) In addition would suggest that Raskolnikov\u2019s mental breakdown is an additional point, but it doesn't capture the direct cause-and-effect nature of the passage.\nB) Nevertheless would imply a contrast, but the passage is focused on the inevitability of Raskolnikov's downfall, not an opposition.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Raskolnikov\u2019s guilt is just an illustration of a broader point, rather than the direct result of his actions."}
