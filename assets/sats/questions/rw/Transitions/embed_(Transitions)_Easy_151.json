Jonathan Harker, an English solicitor, is sent to Dracula's castle to help him with a property purchase. _____, despite the oddities he witnesses during his stay, Harker initially tries to rationalize the strange occurrences and dismisses his growing suspicions about Dracula\u2019s true nature.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Harker\u2019s growing unease and his rationalizations. It highlights the tension between Harker\u2019s logical attempts to dismiss what he perceives as odd and the increasing signs that something is wrong.\nA) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage emphasizes Harker's inner conflict, not a straightforward result.\nB) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Harker\u2019s rationalization is simply an added detail, while the passage focuses on the contradiction between his suspicions and his failure to act.\nD) For example would suggest that Harker's reaction is an illustration of a broader idea, but the passage is about the contradiction in his character\u2014his suspicion versus his inaction."}
