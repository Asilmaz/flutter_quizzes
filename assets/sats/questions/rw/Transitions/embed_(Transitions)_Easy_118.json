{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley explores the consequences of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein, who becomes obsessed with overcoming death. Victor\u2019s creation of the monster is the culmination of his ambition, but he is horrified by the creature\u2019s appearance and rejects it. _____, the monster, abandoned and alone, becomes vengeful and sets out to destroy Victor, leading to a tragic cycle of destruction.", "A": "In addition", "B": "As a result", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Victor\u2019s rejection of the monster and the monster's subsequent vengeful actions. It emphasizes that the monster's bitterness and desire for revenge are direct consequences of being abandoned by his creator.\nA) In addition would imply that the monster\u2019s actions are an additional point to be considered, but the passage is focusing on a direct consequence, not an added detail.\nC) Nevertheless would introduce a contrast, but the sentence is focused on the inevitability of the monster's vengeful actions, not an opposition.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is providing an illustration, but the passage is emphasizing the monster\u2019s reaction to Victor\u2019s actions, not simply illustrating a point."}
