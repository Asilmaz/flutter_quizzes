Throughout the novel, Huck is forced to confront his own moral beliefs as he befriends Jim, a runaway slave. _____, despite his society\u2019s view on race, Huck ultimately decides to help Jim attain freedom, showing his internal growth and rejection of social norms.", "A": "Nevertheless", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Huck's societal upbringing and his decision to help Jim. It emphasizes that, despite the prejudices of the time, Huck\u2019s decision to act on his personal morals highlights his growth and rejection of the societal norms that would normally dictate his actions.\nA) Consequently would imply that Huck\u2019s decision is a direct result of his society\u2019s beliefs, which does not fit the passage's focus on Huck\u2019s moral growth despite societal expectations.\nC) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Huck\u2019s moral decision is just another point, while the passage is focusing on the contrast between his actions and the social norms.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Huck\u2019s decision is an illustration of a broader concept, but the passage is about the tension between Huck\u2019s upbringing and his moral awakening."}
