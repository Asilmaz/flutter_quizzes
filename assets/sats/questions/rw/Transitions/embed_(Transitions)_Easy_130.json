{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Brave New World</em>, Aldous Huxley explores a dystopian society where individuality is suppressed, and people are conditioned to conform to societal norms. The government enforces happiness through technological control and genetic engineering. _____, as the protagonist Bernard Marx begins to question this imposed happiness, he realizes the cost of conformity and starts to challenge the system.", "A": "In addition", "B": "However", "C": "As a result", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between the societal control over happiness and Bernard's growing awareness of the negative consequences of conformity. It emphasizes the shift in Bernard\u2019s thinking from acceptance to rebellion, highlighting the contradiction within the system.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Bernard\u2019s questioning is simply another point in the narrative, when it is actually a turning point that contrasts with the previous theme of conformity.\nB) As a result would imply that Bernard's questioning is a direct consequence of something mentioned earlier, but the passage emphasizes a more gradual realization and shift in perspective.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Bernard's change in perspective is an illustration of a broader point, but the passage is about his internal conflict and resistance to societal norms."}
