{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Animal Farm</em>, George Orwell critiques the dangers of totalitarianism through the story of farm animals overthrowing their human owner. Initially, the animals work together under the leadership of the pigs, striving for equality and freedom. _____, as the pigs gain more power, they begin to resemble the humans they overthrew, highlighting the corruption that power brings and the betrayal of the original ideals.", "A": "Similarly", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In addition", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between the animals\u2019 early ideals of equality and their eventual descent into the same oppressive behavior as their former human oppressors. It emphasizes the change in their leadership and the corruption that follows.\nA) Similarly would imply a comparison between the animals and the humans, which is not the point of the sentence, which focuses on a contrast in their behavior.\nB) Consequently would suggest that the pigs\u2019 increased power naturally leads to their resemblance to humans, but the sentence focuses more on the irony of the situation.\nC) In addition would imply that the pigs\u2019 resemblance to humans is an additional point, but the passage emphasizes the contradiction between the original ideals and the outcome."}
