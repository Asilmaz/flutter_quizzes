{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, John Steinbeck portrays the dreams and struggles of migrant workers during the Great Depression. George and Lennie share a vision of owning a small farm, a dream that keeps them motivated despite their difficult circumstances. _____, their dream ultimately remains unattainable, as external forces beyond their control prevent them from ever achieving it.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "Despite this", "D": "As a result", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Despite This\nThe correct answer, \"Despite this,\" emphasizes the contrast between the characters' enduring hope and the ultimate failure of their dream. It highlights how, despite their continuous effort and aspiration, external factors prevent them from reaching their goal.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly imply that the failure of their dream is a natural consequence of their circumstances, which doesn't capture the sense of struggle against external forces.\nB) Nevertheless would suggest a contrast, but it does not fit the structure of the sentence, which focuses on a tragic outcome rather than an ongoing contradiction.\nD) As a result would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage highlights the inability to attain the dream due to forces beyond their control, not as a simple result."}
