	"text": "Epidemiologists have long warned about the impact of antibiotic resistance. They stress the importance of responsible prescription practices and proper patient education. _____ the rise of superbugs continues at an alarming pace, posing a major threat to global health.",
	"A": "However",
	"B": "Additionally",
	"C": "Hence",
	"D": "Likewise",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Correct choice A: \"However.\" The warnings and recommended actions haven’t prevented the problem from escalating, so the continuing threat stands in contrast to the precautions. \"Hence\" implies a result of the previous statement, which isn’t correct because we’re seeing a contradiction, not a conclusion. \"Likewise\" and \"Additionally\" add a similar point, but a contrast is needed here."
