{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne examines the consequences of sin and the complexities of human nature. Hester Prynne, ostracized for committing adultery, demonstrates resilience and strength as she raises her daughter, Pearl, in isolation. _____, Reverend Dimmesdale, who shares in Hester\u2019s guilt but conceals his role, suffers internally, his health and spirit deteriorating under the weight of his hidden sin.", "A": "As a result", "B": "Similarly", "C": "Because of this", "D": "In contrast", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: In Contrast\nThe correct answer, \"In contrast,\" highlights the difference between Hester\u2019s outward resilience and Dimmesdale\u2019s hidden suffering. This transition effectively emphasizes their opposing responses to the shared burden of guilt.\nB) Similarly would imply that both characters respond to their guilt in the same way, which contradicts the contrast being described in the passage.\nC) Because of this incorrectly suggests that Dimmesdale\u2019s suffering is caused by Hester\u2019s resilience, which misrepresents the relationship between their experiences.\nD) As a result would imply that Dimmesdale\u2019s suffering is directly caused by the situation described, but the focus is on contrasting their reactions, not causation."}
