{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Herman Melville portrays Captain Ahab\u2019s obsessive pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick, as the central conflict of the novel. Ahab is consumed by his need for revenge, and his obsession drives him to take increasingly reckless risks. _____, despite warnings from his crew and the risks involved, Ahab continues his pursuit, leading to the inevitable tragedy that marks the end of the journey.", "A": "For example", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "As a result", "D": "In contrast", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between the warnings of the crew and Ahab's unwavering pursuit of the whale. It emphasizes that, despite knowing the dangers, Ahab\u2019s obsession drives him to continue, leading to his downfall.\nA) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is offering an illustration, while the passage is more about Ahab\u2019s decision despite warnings.\nB) In contrast would imply a stronger opposition between two ideas, but the sentence is showing the tension between Ahab\u2019s obsession and the consequences, not a direct contrast.\nC) As a result would suggest that Ahab's pursuit is a consequence of the warnings, which does not fit the context of his determined refusal to turn back."}
