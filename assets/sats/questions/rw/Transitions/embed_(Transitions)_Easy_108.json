Despite their struggles, they share a dream of owning a small farm, which keeps them hopeful. _____, their dream is shattered when Lennie accidentally kills a woman, leading to his tragic death and the collapse of their plans for the future.", "A": "For example", "B": "As a result", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "In addition", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between Lennie\u2019s accidental killing and the collapse of the dream. It highlights how the tragedy directly leads to the dissolution of George and Lennie\u2019s plans.\nA) For example would incorrectly suggest that the killing is an illustration of the larger point, which is not the focus of the sentence.\nB) Nevertheless would imply a contradiction, but the passage is focused on the inevitability of the dream's collapse as a consequence of the killing.\nD) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, which does not align with the cause-and-effect structure of the sentence."}
