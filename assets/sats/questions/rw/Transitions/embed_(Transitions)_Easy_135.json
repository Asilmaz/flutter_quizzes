{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Dracula</em>, Bram Stoker presents Count Dracula as a mysterious and malevolent figure who seeks to dominate and control those around him. Jonathan Harker, an English solicitor, is sent to Dracula\u2019s castle, where he becomes a prisoner. _____, despite his growing unease and the strange occurrences he witnesses, Harker initially attempts to rationalize the bizarre events and does not act on his suspicions.", "A": "However", "B": "In addition", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Harker\u2019s growing discomfort and his initial unwillingness to act on it. It highlights that, despite the increasing signs of danger, Harker tries to rationalize his experiences rather than act on his suspicions.\nA) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is not suggesting that Harker\u2019s discomfort leads directly to his rationalizations.\nB) In addition would suggest that Harker\u2019s rationalization is another additional point, but the passage focuses on the contrast between his feelings and actions, not just adding another detail.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Harker\u2019s behavior is an illustration of something broader, but the passage is focusing on the contradiction in his character\u2014his knowledge of danger versus his failure to act."}
