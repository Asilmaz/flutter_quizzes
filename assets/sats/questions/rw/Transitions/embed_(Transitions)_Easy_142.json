{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley explores the consequences of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor becomes obsessed with the idea of overcoming death and creating life. After successfully reanimating a dead body, Victor is horrified by his creation and rejects it. _____, the creature, abandoned and isolated, becomes vengeful, leading to a tragic series of events.", "A": "As a result", "B": "For example", "C": "In addition", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Victor's rejection of the creature and the creature's ensuing anger and desire for revenge. It highlights that the creature's vengefulness is a direct consequence of Victor\u2019s actions.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that the creature\u2019s vengefulness is another added point, while the passage is more about the direct cause-and-effect relationship between Victor\u2019s rejection and the creature\u2019s actions.\nB) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is offering an illustration, but it\u2019s focused on the direct consequence of Victor\u2019s rejection.\nD) Nevertheless would introduce a contrast, but the passage emphasizes a direct consequence of Victor\u2019s actions, not a contradiction between his behavior and the outcome."}
