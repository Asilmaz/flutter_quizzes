{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley explores the consequences of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor becomes obsessed with creating life and pushing the boundaries of science, but his obsession leads to tragic outcomes. _____ he succeeds in creating the monster, he soon regrets his actions, realizing too late the consequences of playing God.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "However", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Victor\u2019s initial success in creating life and his subsequent regret. It effectively highlights the shift in his feelings, from triumph to horror, after realizing the consequences of his ambition.\nB) Consequently would incorrectly imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship between his success and regret, which is not the intended meaning of the passage.\nC) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, which does not reflect the contrast between his success and regret.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is illustrating a broader idea, which is not the case here."}
