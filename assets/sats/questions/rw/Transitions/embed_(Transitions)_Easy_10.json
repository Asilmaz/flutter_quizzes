	"text": "Shelley wrote her novel <em>Frankenstein</em> during a stay in Geneva, drawing inspiration from the Romantic fascination with nature and the unknown. _____ her scientific curiosity, sparked by contemporary experiments in galvanism, also influenced her portrayal of creating life from inanimate matter.",
	"A": "Consequently",
	"B": "In addition",
	"C": "For example",
	"D": "However",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Correct choice B: \"In addition.\" The novelâ€™s inspiration also came from scientific inquiry, adding another factor to the Romantic elements. \"Consequently\" would imply cause-and-effect, \"For example\" would cite a specific instance, and \"However\" suggests contrast, which does not apply here."
