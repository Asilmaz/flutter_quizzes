	"A": "Ultimately",
	"B": "Hence",
	"C": "Comparatively",
	"D": "Nevertheless",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Correct choice A: \"Ultimately.\" Despite her initial methodical review, the final step that led to discovery was a bold and innovative techniqueâ€”a culmination of previous efforts. \"Hence\" suggests a direct result, but the text emphasizes the final outcome after preparation, so \"Ultimately\" is better. \"Nevertheless\" introduces contrast, but we need a conclusion-like transition here, and \"Comparatively\" makes no sense in this context."
