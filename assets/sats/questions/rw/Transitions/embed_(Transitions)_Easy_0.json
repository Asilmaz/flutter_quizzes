	"text": "Andrés Segovia played a pivotal role in legitimizing the classical guitar as a concert instrument. He toured extensively throughout Europe, showcasing pieces by Bach, Albeniz, and other composers on the guitar. _____ his pioneering efforts, the instrument gradually earned respect among classical music audiences worldwide.",
	"A": "Instead of",
	"B": "Similarly",
	"C": "As a result of",
	"D": "In contrast to",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Correct choice C: \"As a result of.\" Segovia’s extensive tours and emphasis on classical repertoire led to the guitar being accepted in concert halls, so a cause-and-effect transition is needed. \"Instead of\" suggests a replacement, \"Similarly\" would imply a parallel idea, and \"In contrast to\" implies an opposition, none of which fits here."
