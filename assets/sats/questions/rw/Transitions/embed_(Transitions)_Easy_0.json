Salinger often portrays the complexities of adolescence through his protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden's skepticism about the world is evident in his interactions with adults, whom he frequently criticizes for being \"phony.\" However, his bitterness is not solely directed at others; he also expresses frustration with his own inability to connect meaningfully with others. _____ his complex feelings towards the adult world, Holden\u2019s internal conflict makes him both a relatable and a tragic figure.", "A": "In contrast to", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "Furthermore", "D": "Despite", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Despite\nThe sentence is discussing Holden's internal conflict, which contrasts with his external criticisms of the adult world.
