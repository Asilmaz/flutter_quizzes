{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Odyssey</em>, Homer tells the story of Odysseus\u2019s long and arduous journey home after the Trojan War. Throughout his travels, Odysseus encounters numerous challenges, including the Cyclops and the Sirens, which test his cunning and endurance. _____, despite all these obstacles, Odysseus\u2019s determination to return home never wavers, showing the strength of his resolve.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "However", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between the numerous challenges Odysseus faces and his unyielding determination to return home. It highlights the strength of his resolve despite the setbacks.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is emphasizing Odysseus\u2019s persistence despite the obstacles, not as a direct result of them.\nC) In addition would imply that Odysseus's determination is an additional point, which doesn\u2019t fit with the intended contrast between his challenges and resolve.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is illustrating a broader idea, but it\u2019s about emphasizing Odysseus\u2019s determination rather than providing an example."}
