{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Animal Farm</em>, George Orwell uses the story of a group of animals overthrowing their human owner to create a society of equality. At first, the animals work together to achieve their collective goals, and the farm thrives under their leadership. _____, the pigs begin to take more power for themselves, ultimately recreating the oppressive conditions they had originally rebelled against.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "However", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between the initial success of the animals\u2019 revolution and the later corruption of their leadership. The transition signals the shift from progress to decline, emphasizing the betrayal of the original ideals.\nB) In addition would suggest the sentence is adding to the idea of the animals\u2019 success, which is not accurate given the focus on the pigs\u2019 corruption.\nC) Consequently would imply that the pigs\u2019 corruption was a natural result of the animals\u2019 success, which doesn\u2019t match the context of contrast.\nD) For example suggests the sentence is providing a specific instance of something, but the focus is on a broader shift in leadership and morality."}
