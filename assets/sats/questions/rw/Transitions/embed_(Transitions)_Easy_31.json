Over time, Buck learns to rely on his instincts and becomes a leader among the sled dogs. _____, his growing independence and wild nature signify his ultimate transformation into a creature of the wild, leaving behind his domestic past.", "A": "Similarly", "B": "Despite this", "C": "For example", "D": "As a result", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice A: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship between Buck\u2019s adaptation to his environment and his eventual transformation into a wild creature. The phrase effectively connects his experiences to the ultimate outcome.\nB) Despite this would suggest a contrast, which does not fit the context of the sentence as it describes a progression rather than opposition.\nC) For example would incorrectly imply the sentence provides an illustration of a broader idea, which is not the focus of the passage.\nD) Similarly suggests a comparison, but the sentence does not compare Buck\u2019s transformation to another event or idea."}
