{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Oscar Wilde explores themes of vanity and moral corruption. Dorian Gray remains outwardly youthful and beautiful while his portrait bears the marks of his sinful actions. _____, as Dorian descends further into hedonism, he becomes increasingly tormented by the portrait, which serves as a reminder of his true self.", "A": "However", "B": "Despite this", "C": "Similarly", "D": "Consequently", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Despite This\nThe correct answer, \"Despite this,\" introduces a contrast between Dorian\u2019s outward appearance and his internal torment. It highlights the tension between his physical beauty and the guilt represented by the portrait.\nA) However might seem plausible but doesn\u2019t fit as smoothly here, as it implies a contradiction rather than the nuanced contrast described.\nB) Consequently would suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, which is not the intended meaning of the passage.\nC) Similarly would imply a comparison, which doesn\u2019t align with the contrasting ideas presented."}
