{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the themes of guilt and redemption through the character of Hester Prynne. Hester is publicly shamed for committing adultery, but she chooses to embrace her punishment rather than reveal the identity of her lover. _____, as time passes, Hester becomes a symbol of strength and resilience, and her sin is transformed into a source of strength rather than a mark of shame.", "A": "In contrast", "B": "For example", "C": "Consequently", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Hester\u2019s initial shame and the later transformation of her experience into a source of strength. It highlights how, despite the societal scorn, she evolves into a symbol of endurance.\nA) In contrast would suggest a comparison between two different ideas, but the sentence is about Hester\u2019s internal transformation, not an opposition between two separate elements.\nC) Consequently would incorrectly imply a cause-and-effect relationship, but the sentence emphasizes Hester's gradual evolution rather than a direct result of her actions.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is providing an illustration, but the focus is on Hester's change over time, not an example of a broader idea."}
