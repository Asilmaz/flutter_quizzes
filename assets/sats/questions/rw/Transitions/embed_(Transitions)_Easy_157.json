{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Harper Lee examines the complexities of racism and moral growth through the character of Scout Finch. As she navigates her childhood in the racially divided town of Maycomb, Scout witnesses the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. _____, despite the prejudice and injustice surrounding the trial, Atticus Finch, Scout\u2019s father, defends Tom with integrity and courage, teaching Scout the importance of doing what is right, regardless of public opinion.", "A": "For example", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "In addition", "D": "Consequently", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between the prejudice and injustice surrounding Tom Robinson's trial and Atticus Finch\u2019s decision to defend him with honor. It emphasizes that despite the widespread bias, Atticus remains steadfast in his principles.\nA) For example would suggest that the sentence is illustrating a broader point, but it is not about providing an example\u2014rather, it is highlighting a key contrast in Atticus\u2019s actions.\nB) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Atticus\u2019s integrity is an added point, when the passage is focusing on his moral stance in contrast to the societal prejudice.\nD) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage focuses on a contradiction\u2014Atticus acting honorably despite the public opinion, not a result of the trial."}
