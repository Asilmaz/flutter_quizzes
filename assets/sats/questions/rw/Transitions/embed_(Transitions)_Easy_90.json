Scott Fitzgerald explores the emptiness of the American Dream through the life of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby\u2019s obsessive pursuit of wealth and status is fueled by his desire to rekindle his past love with Daisy Buchanan. _____, despite his success in amassing fortune, Gatsby is unable to achieve his dream of winning Daisy back, revealing the futility of his pursuit.", "A": "In addition", "B": "For example", "C": "As a result", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Gatsby\u2019s material success and his failure to reclaim Daisy\u2019s love. It emphasizes the disillusionment he faces despite achieving what he thought was necessary for his dream.\nA) In addition would suggest that Gatsby\u2019s inability to win Daisy back is an additional point, but the sentence focuses on a contradiction between his success and his failure.\nC) As a result would imply a cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage highlights the contrast between his success and the ultimate futility of his efforts.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Gatsby\u2019s failure is an illustration of a broader idea, but the passage is more focused on the contrast in his experience."}
