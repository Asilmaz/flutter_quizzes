{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Jane Austen examines the complexities of love and marriage through the characters of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth, initially prejudiced against Mr. Darcy due to his arrogance, slowly comes to realize that her judgments were clouded by her own biases. _____, despite her initial rejection of him, Elizabeth ultimately accepts Mr. Darcy\u2019s proposal, recognizing his true character and the depth of his feelings for her.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Elizabeth\u2019s initial rejection of Mr. Darcy and her eventual acceptance of him. It highlights the irony that, despite her early prejudices, Elizabeth\u2019s feelings change as she recognizes Mr. Darcy\u2019s genuine qualities.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s acceptance is just another added point, while the passage emphasizes the contradiction between her initial judgment and her final decision.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is about the contrast between her initial feelings and her later realization, not a straightforward result.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s acceptance is an illustration of a broader idea, but the passage focuses on the internal change Elizabeth undergoes, not an example of a general principle."}
