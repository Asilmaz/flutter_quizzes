{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, F. Scott Fitzgerald depicts Jay Gatsby\u2019s obsessive desire to recapture the past with Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby\u2019s extravagant wealth and lavish parties are all designed to win her back, believing that his success will make him worthy of her love. _____, Daisy\u2019s inability to leave her husband Tom shows that Gatsby\u2019s dream is ultimately unattainable, no matter how much he tries to recreate the past.", "A": "In contrast", "B": "Consequently", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Gatsby\u2019s efforts to recreate the past and Daisy\u2019s inability to leave Tom. It emphasizes that despite Gatsby\u2019s pursuit, the dream he is chasing remains out of reach, highlighting the futility of his attempts.\nA) In contrast would imply a direct comparison between two ideas, but \"Nevertheless\" more effectively emphasizes the contradiction between Gatsby's efforts and the reality of Daisy's choices.\nC) Consequently would suggest that Daisy\u2019s decision was a direct result of Gatsby\u2019s actions, which isn\u2019t accurate.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is providing an example, but it focuses on the contradiction rather than an illustration."}
