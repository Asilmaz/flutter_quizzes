{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, John Steinbeck depicts the Joad family\u2019s struggle during the Great Depression as they travel west in search of a better life. Despite the hardships they face, including poverty, exploitation, and death, they remain determined to reach California. _____, as they encounter more suffering, their resilience grows stronger, and they form deep bonds with other disenfranchised people, showing their ability to adapt and persevere.", "A": "Nevertheless", "B": "For example", "C": "As a result", "D": "In addition", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between the suffering the Joad family endures and their increasing resilience. It shows that, despite the hardships, they continue to grow stronger and maintain hope, illustrating their perseverance.\nA) In addition would imply that the Joad family\u2019s resilience is simply another added point, while the passage is more focused on the contrast between their suffering and growing strength.\nB) For example would suggest the sentence is providing an illustration, but the passage is about the contradictory effect of hardship and resilience, not offering an example of something broader.\nC) As a result would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage emphasizes a more complex shift where hardship leads to stronger bonds and resilience, not just a straightforward result."}
