{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, F. Scott Fitzgerald examines the hollowness of the American Dream through the life of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, born poor, amasses great wealth in an attempt to win back Daisy Buchanan, the woman he loves. He believes that money and material success will allow him to recreate the past. _____, despite his wealth and extravagant parties, Gatsby is unable to recapture his former relationship with Daisy, revealing the futility of his dream.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "However", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Gatsby's material success and his inability to reclaim the past. It emphasizes that, despite his wealth, Gatsby\u2019s dream of being with Daisy remains unfulfilled, which underscores the futility of his pursuit.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Gatsby\u2019s failure to recapture the past is just an additional point, but the passage is focused on the contrast between his success and his inability to achieve his dream.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is about Gatsby\u2019s unfulfilled dream despite his material success, not just a result of his actions.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is giving an illustration, but the passage is about a contradiction between Gatsby's hopes and his reality."}
