{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the effects of sin and guilt on the human soul through the character of Hester Prynne, who is publicly shamed for her adultery. Hester wears the scarlet letter as a symbol of her sin, yet she does not reveal the identity of her partner. _____, despite her public shame, Hester gradually transforms the letter into a symbol of strength and dignity, using it to help others and becoming a respected member of the community.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "However", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Hester\u2019s public shame and her eventual transformation. It emphasizes the shift in how she views the scarlet letter\u2014from a symbol of sin to a mark of strength\u2014despite the negative judgment she initially faces.\nA) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is about the contrast between Hester\u2019s suffering and her eventual strength, not a simple outcome.\nB) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Hester\u2019s transformation is just another added point, while the passage highlights the significant shift in her character.\nD) For example would suggest that Hester\u2019s transformation is an illustration of a broader concept, but the passage is focused on the direct change in her personal meaning and perception of the letter."}
