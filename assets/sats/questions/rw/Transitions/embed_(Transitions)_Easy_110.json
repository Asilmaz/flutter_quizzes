{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne examines the themes of sin, guilt, and redemption through the character of Hester Prynne. Hester is publicly shamed for committing adultery, but she chooses to bear the burden alone rather than reveal the identity of her lover. _____, despite the public disgrace, Hester grows stronger over time and becomes a respected member of the community, showing that her sin has transformed into a source of inner strength.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In contrast", "C": "For example", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between the public shame Hester faces and her internal growth and strength. It emphasizes the idea that, despite the external judgment and suffering, she becomes stronger, showing the irony of her transformation.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, while the passage emphasizes a contrast between Hester\u2019s public humiliation and her personal growth.\nB) In contrast would be too strong and would suggest an opposition between two completely unrelated ideas, but the passage highlights a transformation rather than a direct comparison.\nD) For example would imply that Hester\u2019s growth is an illustration of a broader idea, which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."}
