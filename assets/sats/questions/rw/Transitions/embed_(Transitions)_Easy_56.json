{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Jane Austen portrays Elizabeth Bennet as a woman who values intelligence and integrity. When Mr. Darcy first proposes to Elizabeth, his condescending tone and emphasis on her lower social status lead her to reject him. _____, Darcy\u2019s later actions, including his efforts to help Elizabeth\u2019s family, reveal a humbler and more considerate side, causing her to reevaluate her feelings for him.", "A": "In contrast", "B": "As a result", "C": "Similarly", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: In Contrast\nThe correct answer, \"In contrast,\" highlights the difference between Darcy\u2019s initial condescending behavior and his later actions that show his growth and humility. It sets up the opposition between Elizabeth\u2019s first impression of him and her eventual change in feelings.\nA) As a result would incorrectly suggest that Darcy\u2019s later actions were a direct consequence of Elizabeth\u2019s rejection, which is not explicitly stated in the passage.\nC) Similarly would imply a comparison, which does not fit the sentence\u2019s focus on contrasting behaviors.\nD) Nevertheless would incorrectly suggest that Darcy\u2019s later actions occurred despite his earlier behavior, which does not align with the logical progression described."}
