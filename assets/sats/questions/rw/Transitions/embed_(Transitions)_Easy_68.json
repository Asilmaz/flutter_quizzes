{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Odyssey</em>, Homer tells the story of Odysseus\u2019s long journey home after the Trojan War. Throughout his journey, Odysseus faces numerous challenges, from the Cyclops to the Sirens. He is determined to return to Ithaca and reunite with his wife, Penelope. _____, Odysseus\u2019s journey ultimately takes ten years, as he faces one obstacle after another that delays his return and tests his resolve.", "A": "In addition", "B": "As a result", "C": "Despite", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Odysseus\u2019s determination and the prolonged nature of his journey. It logically connects his determination to the delays he faces during his travels.\nB) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Odysseus\u2019s determination adds to the obstacles he faces, which is not the intended meaning.\nC) Despite would incorrectly imply that Odysseus\u2019s determination and the obstacles are in opposition to each other, which does not fit the sentence.\nD) For example would imply that the sentence is introducing an instance, which does not align with the cause-and-effect nature of the passage."}
