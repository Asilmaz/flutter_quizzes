{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Charlotte Bront\u00eb explores themes of independence and self-respect through the character of Jane, who overcomes a difficult childhood and societal limitations. After Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester, she discovers a dark secret about his past. _____, she chooses to leave him, rejecting a life built on lies, even though it causes her great emotional pain.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In contrast", "C": "Despite this", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: Despite This\nThe correct answer, \"Despite this,\" introduces a contrast between Jane\u2019s emotional pain and her decision to leave Mr. Rochester. It highlights her moral strength and decision to prioritize integrity over personal happiness, despite the difficulty.\nA) Consequently would imply a cause-and-effect relationship, but the sentence describes a more complex, morally motivated decision rather than a direct outcome of her discovery.\nB) In contrast would be too strong, as it suggests an opposition between two unrelated ideas, while the passage focuses on Jane\u2019s personal struggle with her decision.\nC) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is providing an illustration, which does not align with the meaning of the passage."}
