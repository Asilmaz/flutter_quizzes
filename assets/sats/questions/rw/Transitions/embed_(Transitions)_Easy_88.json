{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley explores the consequences of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor\u2019s obsession with conquering death leads him to create a living being, but his immediate horror at the result causes him to abandon the creature. _____, the creature, neglected and isolated, becomes vengeful, seeking revenge on Victor for his creator's rejection.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "Despite this", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between Victor\u2019s rejection of the creature and the creature\u2019s vengeful actions. It highlights how Victor\u2019s neglect leads directly to the creature\u2019s feelings of anger and the resulting tragic events.\nB) In addition would suggest that the creature\u2019s vengefulness is an additional point, which doesn't align with the cause-and-effect relationship described.\nC) Despite this would imply a contrast, suggesting that the creature\u2019s vengefulness happened in opposition to the rejection, which doesn't reflect the intended meaning.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is providing an illustration rather than focusing on the consequences of Victor\u2019s actions."}
