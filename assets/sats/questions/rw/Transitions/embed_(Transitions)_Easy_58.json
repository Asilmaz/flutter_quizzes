{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Charlotte Bront\u00eb portrays Jane as a principled and resilient woman who values integrity above all else. When Jane discovers that Mr. Rochester is already married, she chooses to leave Thornfield Hall, despite her deep love for him. _____, her decision to prioritize her moral values over her emotions highlights her inner strength and commitment to doing what she believes is right.", "A": "As a result", "B": "In contrast", "C": "For example", "D": "Consequently", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice D: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship between Jane\u2019s discovery of Rochester\u2019s secret and her decision to leave. It logically ties her moral integrity to the outcome of her departure.\nA) Consequently could seem plausible but does not fit as smoothly in this context, as it implies a broader result rather than focusing specifically on Jane\u2019s decision.\nB) In contrast suggests opposition, which does not align with the direct progression described in the passage.\nC) For example implies an illustrative point, which is not the purpose of the sentence."}
