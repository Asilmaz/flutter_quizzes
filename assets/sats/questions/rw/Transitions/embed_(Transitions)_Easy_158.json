{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, Mark Twain explores themes of race and morality through the friendship between Huck and Jim, a runaway slave. Huck, raised in a society that dehumanizes black people, initially views Jim as inferior. _____, as Huck journeys with Jim down the Mississippi River, he begins to see Jim\u2019s humanity, eventually realizing that his friendship with Jim is more important than society's racist beliefs.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "For example", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Huck's initial beliefs and his eventual change in perspective. It emphasizes that despite Huck's early conditioning and prejudices, his experiences with Jim lead him to value their friendship above societal expectations.\nA) Consequently would imply that Huck\u2019s shift in perspective is a direct result of his journey, but the passage highlights the contrast between Huck's early thoughts and his later realizations.\nB) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Huck\u2019s change of heart is just another point, while the passage is focused on the contrast between Huck\u2019s initial prejudices and his later moral awakening.\nD) For example would suggest that Huck\u2019s shift in perspective is an illustration, but the passage emphasizes the internal change Huck undergoes, not an example of a broader idea."}
