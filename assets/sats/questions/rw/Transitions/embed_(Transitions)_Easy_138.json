Anna\u2019s affair with Vronsky causes her to break away from her husband, Karenin, and abandon her former life. _____, despite the intense passion she feels for Vronsky, Anna\u2019s emotional turmoil leads her to a tragic end, demonstrating the destructive consequences of living outside societal norms.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "For example", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Anna\u2019s passionate affair with Vronsky and the tragic consequences she faces. It highlights that, despite the intensity of her feelings, the emotional turmoil she experiences leads to her downfall.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Anna\u2019s tragic end is an additional point, but the passage focuses on the contrast between her passion and the consequences of her actions.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which doesn't capture the contrast between Anna\u2019s love and the ultimate tragedy.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is providing an illustration, but the passage is about Anna\u2019s emotional conflict and its tragic outcome, not an example."}
