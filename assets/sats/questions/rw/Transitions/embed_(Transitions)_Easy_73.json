{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley explores the destructive consequences of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life and surpassing natural boundaries, but his obsession leads to isolation and guilt. _____, he refuses to take responsibility for the creature he creates, which leads to further tragedy and destruction.", "A": "Despite this", "B": "Consequently", "C": "For example", "D": "Similarly", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" highlights the cause-and-effect relationship between Victor\u2019s refusal to take responsibility for the creature and the further negative consequences that follow. It connects his actions directly to the tragic outcomes described.\nB) Despite this would suggest a contradiction, implying that Victor\u2019s actions were in opposition to the tragedy, which is not the intended meaning.\nC) For example would introduce an illustration, which is not the focus of the passage.\nD) Similarly suggests a comparison, which does not fit the cause-and-effect nature of the sentence."}
