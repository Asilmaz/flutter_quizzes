Ahab's single-minded pursuit of the whale leads him to ignore the well-being of his crew, and he becomes increasingly isolated. _____, his obsession ultimately leads to his death and the destruction of the Pequod, showing the dangers of unchecked ambition.", "A": "As a result", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "For example", "D": "In contrast", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship between Ahab\u2019s obsession with the whale and the eventual tragic outcome of his pursuit. It logically connects Ahab\u2019s actions to the consequences that follow.\nA) Nevertheless would imply a contrast or contradiction, which does not fit with the cause-and-effect structure of the sentence.\nC) For example would suggest the sentence is providing an illustration, but the focus is on the consequences of Ahab\u2019s obsession, not on a specific example.\nD) In contrast would suggest a comparison between Ahab\u2019s obsession and another idea or character, which is not the intent of the sentence."}
