Jane\u2019s relationship with Mr. Rochester challenges her sense of self-worth, as she falls in love with a man who is already married. _____, despite her love for him, Jane ultimately chooses to leave Mr. Rochester when she learns the truth about his past, demonstrating her strong moral principles.", "A": "However", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Jane\u2019s love for Mr. Rochester and her decision to leave him in order to maintain her integrity. It emphasizes the moral dilemma Jane faces and her final decision to uphold her values, despite her emotions.\nA) In addition would suggest that Jane's moral decision is an added point, but the passage focuses on the contrast between her emotions and her strong sense of self-respect.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is more about the tension between Jane\u2019s love and her moral principles, not a direct result.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Jane\u2019s decision is simply an illustration of a broader concept, but the passage is focused on the specific, significant choice she makes."}
