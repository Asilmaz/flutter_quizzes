	"text": "Economic sanctions can put pressure on a nation's government to change specific policies. They often have unintended consequences, such as harming innocent civilians or disrupting global supply chains. _____ policymakers must weigh both the potential gains and the potential human costs before enacting sanctions.",
	"A": "Therefore",
	"B": "By contrast",
	"C": "Nevertheless",
	"D": "In fact",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Correct choice A: \"Therefore.\" The negative side effects highlight the need for careful consideration, so a concluding cause-and-effect link is appropriate. \"By contrast\" would focus on an opposing idea, \"Nevertheless\" suggests a contradiction, and \"In fact\" emphasizes a point without linking it to a previous statement as strongly."
