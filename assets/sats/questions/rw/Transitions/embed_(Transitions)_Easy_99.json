Scout begins as an innocent child, unaware of the deep-seated racial prejudices in her town. _____, after witnessing the trial of Tom Robinson, Scout begins to understand the complexities of human nature and the importance of empathy, especially when it comes to judging others.", "A": "Therefore", "B": "In addition", "C": "However", "D": "As a result", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Scout\u2019s initial innocence and the moral growth she experiences as she confronts the reality of racism. It emphasizes the shift in her understanding of the world and human behavior.\nA) Therefore would imply a cause-and-effect relationship, which does not fit as Scout\u2019s understanding of the world develops gradually, not as a direct consequence of a single event.\nB) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, which doesn\u2019t reflect the contrast between Scout\u2019s earlier naivety and her eventual awareness.\nC) As a result would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which oversimplifies Scout\u2019s evolution in the narrative."}
