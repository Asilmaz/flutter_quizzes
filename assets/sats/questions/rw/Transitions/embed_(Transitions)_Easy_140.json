{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne examines the consequences of sin and guilt through the character of Hester Prynne, who is publicly shamed for committing adultery. Hester chooses to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her sin and bears the shame without revealing the identity of her partner. _____, despite her public humiliation, Hester grows stronger over time, eventually becoming a respected and compassionate member of her community.", "A": "Nevertheless", "B": "In addition", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Hester\u2019s public humiliation and her eventual growth into a respected member of the community. It emphasizes that, despite the shame she faces, she is able to rise above it and become stronger.\nA) In addition would imply that Hester\u2019s growth is simply another point to be considered, but the passage is about showing the contrast between her suffering and her personal development.\nC) Consequently would suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is more about the paradox of Hester\u2019s strength emerging from her suffering.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Hester\u2019s transformation is merely an illustration, but the passage focuses on the complex interplay between shame and resilience."}
