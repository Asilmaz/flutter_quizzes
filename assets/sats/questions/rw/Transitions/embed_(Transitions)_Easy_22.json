Throughout his journey, Odysseus encounters numerous challenges, including the Cyclops, the Sirens, and the wrath of the gods. _____ his intelligence and cunning help him overcome many obstacles, Odysseus\u2019s hubris often leads him into further danger, demonstrating the conflict between human ability and divine will.", "A": "Because of", "B": "In spite of", "C": "Although", "D": "As", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Although\nThe correct answer, \"Although,\" introduces a contrast between Odysseus's intelligence and his tendency to act with excessive pride (hubris), which leads to further challenges. This sets up a balance between his strengths and his flaws.\nB) In spite of would work similarly, but \"Although\" fits more naturally in this context, especially since it introduces a more fluid contrast between two related concepts (intelligence and hubris).\nC) Because of would imply a causal relationship, suggesting that Odysseus's intelligence directly leads to his danger, which is not the case here.\nD) As could be misinterpreted as implying simultaneity, but it doesn\u2019t clearly highlight the contrast between his intelligence and his hubris."}
