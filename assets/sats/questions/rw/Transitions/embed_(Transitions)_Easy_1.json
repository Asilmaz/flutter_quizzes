	"text": "Marie Curie pioneered groundbreaking research on radioactivity, which led to multiple scientific and medical advances. She remained modest about her achievements, refusing to patent her discoveries. _____ her peers lobbied heavily for her to be recognized with a Nobel Prize for her work.",
	"A": "By contrast",
	"B": "Meanwhile",
	"C": "Nevertheless",
	"D": "Therefore",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Correct choice C: \"Nevertheless.\" Curie's modesty might have suggested she would stay out of the spotlight, yet her peers still pushed for her recognition, which indicates a contrast. \"Therefore\" would imply a direct cause-and-effect link. \"By contrast\" compares two opposing points, but it doesn't capture the nuance of perseverance against her modesty. \"Meanwhile\" introduces simultaneous events, not a contrast."
