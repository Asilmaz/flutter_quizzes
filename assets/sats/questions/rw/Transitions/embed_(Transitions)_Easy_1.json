Elizabeth Bennet, the novel's protagonist, initially resents the pressure to marry for status rather than for love. She values personal integrity above social standing and rejects the idea that a woman\u2019s worth is determined by her marriage prospects. _____ Elizabeth\u2019s firm beliefs, her developing relationship with Mr. Darcy demonstrates the importance of personal growth and mutual respect in a partnership.", "A": "In light of", "B": "However", "C": "For example", "D": "In spite of", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: In Spite Of\nThe sentence introduces a contrast between Elizabeth's strong personal beliefs and her changing feelings toward Mr. Darcy.
