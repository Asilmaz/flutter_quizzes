{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Charlotte Bront\u00eb portrays the journey of a young orphan, Jane, as she navigates her way through a harsh world. Jane\u2019s strength and resilience are tested as she faces many trials, from her cruel aunt to the oppressive conditions at Lowood School. _____, her experiences shape her into a strong, independent woman who learns to stand up for herself and others.", "A": "In contrast", "B": "As a result", "C": "Despite", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" introduces a cause-and-effect relationship, highlighting how Jane\u2019s hardships lead to her growth as a person. It logically connects her trials to her transformation into an independent woman.\nB) In contrast would suggest a comparison, but the sentence is focusing on the relationship between Jane\u2019s struggles and her personal growth, not comparing two ideas.\nC) Despite would imply a contradiction, but the passage describes how Jane\u2019s experiences contribute to her development, not how they are opposed.\nD) For example would imply an illustration of a broader idea, which does not fit the context of the passage that focuses on the impact of Jane\u2019s experiences."}
