{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>1984</em>, George Orwell depicts a dystopian society where the government, led by Big Brother, exercises complete control over every aspect of citizens' lives. Winston Smith, the protagonist, becomes disillusioned with the Party and begins to secretly rebel. _____, despite his growing desire for freedom, Winston is ultimately unable to escape the Party's surveillance and thought control, highlighting the hopelessness of individual resistance in such a regime.", "A": "In addition", "B": "For example", "C": "Consequently", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Winston\u2019s desire for freedom and the reality of his inability to escape the Party's control. It emphasizes that, despite his rebellious thoughts and actions, Winston cannot overcome the overwhelming power of the government.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Winston\u2019s inability to escape is just an additional point, while the passage is focused on the contrast between his desire for freedom and his defeat.\nC) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is more about the tension between Winston\u2019s internal rebellion and the external forces that crush it.\nD) For example would suggest that Winston's failure is merely an illustration of a broader concept, but the passage highlights the contradiction between Winston\u2019s desire and his ultimate defeat."}
