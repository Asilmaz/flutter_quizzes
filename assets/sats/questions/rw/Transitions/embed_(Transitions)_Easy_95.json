{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Oscar Wilde explores the corrupting influence of vanity and hedonism through the character of Dorian Gray. Dorian remains outwardly youthful and beautiful while his portrait bears the marks of his moral decay. _____, as Dorian\u2019s hedonistic lifestyle spirals out of control, his obsession with preserving his beauty and youth ultimately leads to his destruction.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "For example", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" establishes the cause-and-effect relationship between Dorian\u2019s hedonistic lifestyle and his eventual downfall. It connects his indulgence in pleasures with the tragic result of his actions, making it the most logical transition.\nA) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is offering an illustration, rather than showing the inevitable outcome of his actions.\nB) In addition would imply an additive relationship, but the sentence is about the direct consequence of his behavior.\nD) Nevertheless would introduce a contrast, which doesn't fit the logical progression of cause and effect in the sentence."}
