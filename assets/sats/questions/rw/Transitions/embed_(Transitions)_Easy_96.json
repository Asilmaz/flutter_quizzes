{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley delves into the consequences of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor\u2019s obsessive desire to surpass natural boundaries leads him to create life. _____, when he is horrified by the creature\u2019s appearance and rejects it, his failure to take responsibility leads to the creature\u2019s rage and the unfolding tragedy.", "A": "As a result", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "In addition", "D": "However", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" highlights the cause-and-effect relationship between Victor\u2019s rejection of the creature and the tragic consequences that follow. It emphasizes that his failure to assume responsibility led directly to the creature\u2019s subsequent actions.\nA) In addition would imply that the creature\u2019s rage is an additional point rather than a direct outcome of Victor\u2019s actions.\nB) Nevertheless would suggest a contrast, but the sentence is focused on a direct consequence rather than an opposition between ideas.\nD) However would indicate a contradiction, but the passage describes a progression of events, not a reversal or opposition."}
