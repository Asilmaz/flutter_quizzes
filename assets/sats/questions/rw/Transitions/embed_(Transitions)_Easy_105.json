{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, F. Scott Fitzgerald explores the idea of the American Dream through the character of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby's success is built on his desire to win back Daisy Buchanan, the woman he loves, believing that wealth and status will make him worthy of her. _____, despite all his wealth and the grandeur of his parties, Gatsby is unable to win Daisy back, revealing the emptiness at the heart of his pursuit.", "A": "In addition", "B": "However", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Gatsby's outward success and the failure of his dream. It emphasizes the discrepancy between his material achievements and his ultimate inability to reclaim Daisy\u2019s love.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Gatsby\u2019s failure is an additional point to his success, which contradicts the contrast being made in the passage.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which does not capture the tension between Gatsby's wealth and his unfulfilled dream.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is providing an illustration of Gatsby\u2019s pursuit, but the focus is more on the contrast in his life and aspirations."}
