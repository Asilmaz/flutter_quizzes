{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Harper Lee explores themes of morality, racial injustice, and the loss of innocence through the experiences of Scout Finch. When Scout first encounters racism and hatred, she struggles to understand the reasons behind these injustices. _____, as the trial of Tom Robinson progresses, Scout begins to realize the complexity of human nature and the pervasive nature of prejudice in her society.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "However", "D": "As a result", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Scout\u2019s initial confusion about racism and her growing understanding as the trial unfolds. It emphasizes the shift in her perception as she is confronted with the harsh realities of the world around her.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage focuses more on the contrast between Scout\u2019s early naivety and her later realizations.\nB) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, which does not align with the contrast between Scout\u2019s initial and developing understanding.\nC) As a result would imply a causal connection, which is less fitting given the context of her evolving moral awareness."}
