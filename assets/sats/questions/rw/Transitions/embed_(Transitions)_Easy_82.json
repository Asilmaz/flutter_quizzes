{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, Emily Bront\u00eb presents the intense and destructive relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Their love is marked by cruelty, passion, and obsession, and it ultimately leads to tragedy. _____, Catherine\u2019s death leaves Heathcliff consumed by grief, and he becomes even more vengeful, reflecting the destructive power of their love.", "A": "Therefore", "B": "In contrast", "C": "However", "D": "As a result", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between the passionate relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine and the destructive consequences that follow. It highlights the shift from their intense love to Heathcliff\u2019s eventual grief and vengeance.\nA) Therefore would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the sentence focuses on a contrast in the aftermath of Catherine\u2019s death rather than a straightforward outcome.\nB) In contrast would be too strong, as it suggests a greater difference than is intended in the passage.\nD) As a result would similarly imply a cause-and-effect relationship that oversimplifies the passage\u2019s emphasis on the emotional turmoil Heathcliff experiences."}
