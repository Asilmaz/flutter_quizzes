{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, Mark Twain critiques the societal norms of his time through the journey of Huck and Jim. Huck initially feels conflicted about helping Jim, a runaway slave, due to the values he has been taught. _____, as their journey progresses, Huck begins to question the morality of these beliefs and chooses to prioritize his friendship with Jim over the expectations of society.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "As a result", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Huck\u2019s initial internal conflict and his eventual decision to reject societal norms. It effectively highlights Huck\u2019s moral growth and the shift in his perspective.\nA) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which doesn\u2019t fit the contrast being described.\nC) As a result similarly suggests causality, which oversimplifies Huck\u2019s moral evolution.\nD) In addition implies an additive relationship, which doesn\u2019t align with the sentence\u2019s focus on contrasting Huck\u2019s beliefs over time."}
