{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Silent Spring</em>, Rachel Carson outlined the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, particularly focusing on their impact on birds. Her research raised widespread public awareness about the dangers of chemical pollution. _____ Carson\u2019s book is often credited with launching the modern environmental movement and leading to stricter regulations on pesticide use.", "A": "Subsequently", "B": "For example", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "Instead", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Subsequently\nThe correct answer, \"Subsequently,\" indicates a chronological relationship, showing that Carson\u2019s work directly influenced the public and government actions that followed. Her book\u2019s impact is presented as the logical next step in the sequence of events.\nB) For example would incorrectly suggest that the environmental movement was just one instance of her book's impact, whereas the sentence presents the movement as a broader consequence.\nC) Nevertheless would imply a contrast, which doesn\u2019t fit because the sentence emphasizes the continuation of cause and effect rather than opposition.\nD) Instead would signal an alternative, which is not logical here, as the sentence discusses a result rather than an alternative action."}
