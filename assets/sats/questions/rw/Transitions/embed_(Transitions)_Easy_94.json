{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Charlotte Bront\u00eb examines the theme of independence through the character of Jane, who refuses to marry Mr. Rochester when he offers her a life of luxury as his mistress. Jane values her own dignity too much to accept an arrangement that would compromise her principles. _____, after overcoming numerous hardships, she returns to Mr. Rochester when she learns he has suffered greatly, and they are reunited on more equal terms.", "A": "As a result", "B": "In addition", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Jane\u2019s initial refusal to marry Mr. Rochester based on her principles and her eventual return to him, albeit under different circumstances. It highlights the shift in her feelings and the change in their relationship dynamic.\nA) As a result would incorrectly suggest that Jane\u2019s return is a direct consequence of her earlier refusal, but the passage shows a shift in her perspective due to new information.\nC) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, which doesn\u2019t fit the contrast being described.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Jane\u2019s decision is an illustration of a broader point, but the passage is emphasizing a change in her decision-making process."}
