{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the themes of guilt and redemption through the character of Hester Prynne. Hester bears the shame of her sin publicly, but instead of succumbing to despair, she grows stronger and more compassionate. _____, her refusal to reveal the identity of her child\u2019s father, Arthur Dimmesdale, causes her intense suffering, yet it ultimately leads to her spiritual growth.", "A": "In addition", "B": "However", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Hester\u2019s outward strength and the inner suffering she experiences due to keeping Dimmesdale\u2019s secret. It emphasizes that while she becomes stronger, her decision comes with its own emotional cost.\nA) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, but the passage is describing a contrast, not an addition.\nC) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the sentence is about Hester\u2019s inner conflict, not a simple result.\nD) For example would incorrectly introduce an illustration rather than a contrast."}
