{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, J.D. Salinger portrays Holden Caulfield as a disillusioned teenager who rejects the phoniness of the adult world. Holden\u2019s alienation grows as he encounters people who seem insincere or shallow. _____, his deep connection to his younger sister Phoebe reveals that he still longs for authenticity and love, even as he distances himself from others.", "A": "For example", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In contrast", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Holden\u2019s criticism of the adult world and his continuing need for genuine human connection. It emphasizes that despite his cynicism, he still craves authenticity, especially in his relationship with Phoebe.\nA) For example would imply that Holden\u2019s connection to Phoebe is an illustration of his general attitude, but the sentence is emphasizing a contrast, not an example.\nC) In contrast might seem plausible but would be too strong, as it implies a sharp opposition between two completely different ideas, which isn\u2019t fully the case here.\nD) Consequently would suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage describes Holden\u2019s internal conflict rather than a direct result of his actions."}
