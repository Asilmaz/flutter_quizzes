{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, Fyodor Dostoevsky delves into the mind of Rodion Raskolnikov, a young man who believes he is intellectually superior to others and, therefore, justifies committing murder for a greater good. However, after the crime, Raskolnikov begins to experience intense guilt and paranoia, feeling increasingly isolated from society. _____, despite his moral struggle, Raskolnikov continues to rationalize his actions, revealing his internal conflict between his pride and his sense of guilt.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "For example", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Raskolnikov\u2019s internal moral struggle and his continued rationalization of the murder. It emphasizes that, despite his guilt and paranoia, he cannot fully reconcile his actions, reflecting the conflict within him.\nA) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which does not align with the passage\u2019s focus on the contradiction in Raskolnikov's mind.\nB) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Raskolnikov\u2019s rationalizations are an additional point, while the passage is about the contrast between his internal conflict and his actions.\nD) For example would suggest that Raskolnikov's continued rationalization is illustrating a broader concept, but the passage highlights the tension between his pride and guilt, not offering an illustration of a wider idea."}
