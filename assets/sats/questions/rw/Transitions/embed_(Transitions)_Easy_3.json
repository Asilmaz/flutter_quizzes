	"text": "Fans of ancient Greek drama often focus on Athens as the epicenter of theatrical innovation. _____ scholars have turned their attention to the lesser-known city of Syracuse, which also contributed to the art form’s evolution through playwrights and performances of equal sophistication.",
	"A": "On the contrary",
	"B": "Indeed",
	"C": "Subsequently",
	"D": "However",
	"correct": "D",
	"explanation": "Correct choice D: \"However.\" The mention of Athens’s fame is contrasted by the fact that Syracuse also played a key role, so we need a transition that shows an unexpected shift in focus. \"Indeed\" would reinforce the same idea about Athens, not introduce a new contrasting location. \"Subsequently\" suggests time order rather than contrast, and \"On the contrary\" can be overly forceful here."
