	"text": "Jamal overcame a steep learning curve when he started playing the violin at a later age than most. He practiced diligently for hours each day. _____ his efforts, he earned a chair in the regional youth orchestra.",
	"A": "In spite of",
	"B": "Because of",
	"C": "On the contrary",
	"D": "Even so",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Correct choice B: \"Because of.\" Jamalâ€™s intensive practice led directly to his success, so a cause-and-effect transition is needed. \"In spite of\" contradicts the notion that practice was beneficial, \"On the contrary\" introduces an opposing statement, and \"Even so\" would suggest a surprising outcome. Here, it's a straightforward result."
