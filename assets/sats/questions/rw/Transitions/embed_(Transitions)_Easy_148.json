{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Herman Melville portrays Captain Ahab\u2019s obsessive quest to hunt the white whale, Moby Dick. Ahab\u2019s fixation on the whale grows as he convinces his crew to join him in his vengeful mission. _____, despite the dangers and the costs, Ahab remains unwavering in his pursuit, even as it leads to the destruction of both himself and his crew.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between the risks and Ahab's unrelenting determination. It highlights that even though the pursuit of Moby Dick brings increasing danger, Ahab's obsession remains unshaken, leading to his and the crew's downfall.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Ahab's determination is an added point, while the passage is more about the contrast between his obsession and the inevitable consequences.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is about the persistent nature of Ahab's obsession despite the looming danger, not a direct result of earlier actions.\nD) For example would suggest that Ahab\u2019s actions are an illustration, but the passage focuses on the contradiction between Ahab\u2019s determination and the destruction it causes, not a general example."}
