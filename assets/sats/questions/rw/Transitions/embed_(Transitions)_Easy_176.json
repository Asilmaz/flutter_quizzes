{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em>, Arthur Conan Doyle presents Sherlock Holmes as a brilliant detective whose powers of observation and deduction allow him to solve complex mysteries. Dr. Watson, his loyal companion, is often amazed by Holmes's ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues. _____, Watson himself begins to appreciate the intricacies of Holmes\u2019s methods and gains a deeper understanding of the detective\u2019s genius, even if he does not fully grasp every detail.", "A": "For example", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In addition", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: In Addition\nThe correct answer, \"In addition,\" indicates that Watson\u2019s growing appreciation of Holmes\u2019s methods is an additional point in the passage, building on the idea of Watson\u2019s increasing admiration for his companion\u2019s abilities. It highlights the natural progression of Watson\u2019s understanding of Holmes\u2019s brilliance.\nA) For example would incorrectly suggest that Watson's growing understanding is an illustration of something broader, but the passage is about his direct progression of appreciation.\nB) Consequently would imply a cause-and-effect relationship, but Watson\u2019s growing understanding isn\u2019t simply a direct result of Holmes\u2019s actions; it is more a gradual shift in perception.\nC) Nevertheless would suggest a contrast between Watson\u2019s admiration and his understanding, but the passage is more about the development of Watson\u2019s recognition, not a contradiction."}
