	"text": "The sculptor used fragments of recycled metal to create a striking abstract figure. Each welded piece seemed haphazard at first glance. _____ a closer look revealed a purposeful balance between form and negative space.",
	"A": "Nevertheless",
	"B": "Furthermore",
	"C": "Because of this",
	"D": "Hence",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Correct choice A: \"Nevertheless.\" The text moves from describing something that appears messy to revealing underlying harmony, so a transition that indicates contrast is needed. \"Furthermore\" would add an additional point but not provide a contradiction, \"Because of this\" implies cause and effect, and \"Hence\" signals a concluding inference rather than contrast."
