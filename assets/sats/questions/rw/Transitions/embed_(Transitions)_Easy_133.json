{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Herman Melville examines the destructive nature of obsession through the character of Captain Ahab, who becomes fixated on hunting the white whale, Moby Dick. Ahab's single-minded pursuit consumes him, driving him to disregard the safety of his crew and the potential consequences of his actions. _____, despite his obsession, Ahab continues his pursuit with unwavering determination, leading to the eventual tragedy of the voyage.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "However", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Ahab's obsession and the tragic consequences that follow. It highlights the contradiction that, despite the dangers and the moral cost, Ahab\u2019s obsession drives him to continue his pursuit, ultimately leading to disaster.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly suggest that Ahab\u2019s continued pursuit is a direct result of his obsession, but the passage emphasizes the internal conflict between his obsession and the consequences, not just a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship.\nB) In addition would imply that Ahab\u2019s determination is another added point, but the passage is about showing the contrast between his obsession and its outcome, not an additional detail.\nD) For example would suggest the sentence is providing an illustration, but it is more about highlighting the tension in Ahab\u2019s character and the eventual consequences."}
