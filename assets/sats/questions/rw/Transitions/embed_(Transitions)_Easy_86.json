{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, J.D. Salinger depicts Holden Caulfield as a disillusioned teenager who is critical of the adult world. He often rejects the norms and behaviors he perceives as \"phony,\" pushing away those who try to help him. _____, Holden still longs for connection, especially in his relationship with his younger sister Phoebe, demonstrating that, despite his cynicism, he is not entirely lost.", "A": "Similarly", "B": "Consequently", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Holden\u2019s cynicism and his desire for genuine connection, particularly with Phoebe. It highlights the contradiction in his character, as he simultaneously rejects society while still longing for authenticity and closeness.\nA) Similarly would suggest a comparison between Holden\u2019s behavior and his relationship with Phoebe, which is not the focus of the passage.\nC) Consequently would suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage emphasizes contrast rather than causality.\nD) For example would incorrectly imply that Holden\u2019s relationship with Phoebe is simply an illustration of his attitude, whereas it actually reveals a deeper complexity in his character."}
