{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Oscar Wilde examines the consequences of vanity and hedonism through the character of Dorian Gray. Dorian remains outwardly youthful and beautiful while his portrait bears the physical marks of his moral corruption. _____, his inability to face the reality of his actions leads to his eventual downfall, as he is consumed by guilt and despair.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "Despite this", "C": "Similarly", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between Dorian\u2019s denial of his moral corruption and his eventual tragic end. It logically connects his refusal to face the truth with the resulting collapse of his life.\nB) Despite this would suggest a contradiction, implying that Dorian\u2019s downfall is unrelated to his denial of his actions, which is not the intended meaning.\nC) Similarly would imply a comparison, which does not fit the sentence\u2019s focus on cause and effect.\nD) For example would imply that the sentence is providing a specific instance of a broader idea, which is not the case here."}
