{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, F. Scott Fitzgerald illustrates the emptiness of the American Dream through the character of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby amasses wealth and throws lavish parties in an attempt to win back Daisy Buchanan, believing that material success will make him worthy of her love. _____, despite all his efforts, Daisy remains with her husband, Tom, revealing the illusion of Gatsby\u2019s dream and the failure of his pursuit.", "A": "However", "B": "In addition", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Gatsby\u2019s relentless pursuit of his dream and the reality that Daisy does not reciprocate his feelings. It emphasizes the disillusionment Gatsby faces despite his efforts.\nA) Consequently would suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which doesn\u2019t align with the contrast being made between Gatsby\u2019s dreams and the outcome.\nB) In addition would imply that something additional is being added, but the passage focuses on the contradiction between Gatsby\u2019s hope and Daisy\u2019s choices.\nD) For example would imply that the sentence is providing an illustration, which doesn\u2019t fit the sentence's focus on the contrast between Gatsby\u2019s efforts and his failure."}
