As the novel progresses, the characters realize the extent of Dracula\u2019s influence and the danger he poses. _____ the group\u2019s increasing efforts to stop him, Dracula remains elusive and continues to exert his power, creating a sense of helplessness among his enemies.", "A": "Because of", "B": "In spite of", "C": "Despite", "D": "As", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Despite\nThe correct answer, \"Despite,\" introduces the contrast between the characters' efforts to stop Dracula and his continued power. It indicates that, even though they try harder to defeat him, Dracula remains a formidable and untouchable force.\nB) In spite of is a possible choice but is less natural in this sentence. \"Despite\" flows better and is more commonly used in this context.\nC) Because of would suggest that Dracula\u2019s ability to evade capture is the result of the group\u2019s efforts, which contradicts the intended meaning.\nD) As would imply that Dracula's power is in line with the group\u2019s efforts, which doesn\u2019t highlight the contrast properly."}
