{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne examines the themes of guilt, sin, and redemption through the character of Hester Prynne, who is publicly shamed for bearing an illegitimate child. As a result of her sin, Hester is forced to wear the scarlet letter \"A\" as a symbol of her shame. _____, despite her public punishment, Hester chooses to raise her child, Pearl, with strength and dignity, refusing to reveal the name of Pearl\u2019s father.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "In addition", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Hester's punishment and her decision to raise her child with dignity. It emphasizes that, despite the public shaming and the societal judgment, Hester remains strong and steadfast in her resolve.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is more about the contrast between Hester's internal strength and the external shame she faces, not a direct result of her punishment.\nB) In addition would imply that Hester's strength is just another added point, while the passage focuses on the tension between her shame and her resilience.\nD) For example would suggest that Hester\u2019s strength is an illustration of a broader idea, but the passage is more focused on the contrast between her suffering and her dignity."}
