{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, John Steinbeck tells the story of two displaced migrant workers, George and Lennie, during the Great Depression. Lennie, who has a mental disability, is deeply dependent on George for guidance and protection. _____, despite George\u2019s care for Lennie, their dream of owning a piece of land together remains unattainable, and Lennie\u2019s actions ultimately lead to tragic consequences.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between George\u2019s dedication to caring for Lennie and the tragic reality that their dream is never realized. It emphasizes that, despite George\u2019s efforts, external circumstances and Lennie\u2019s actions lead to a tragic outcome.\nA) In addition would suggest that the unattainability of their dream is just an added point, but the passage focuses on the contrast between George\u2019s care and the inevitable failure of their dream.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage emphasizes the tension between George\u2019s protective actions and the eventual failure of their dream, rather than a simple consequence.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Lennie\u2019s actions are just an illustration of a broader concept, but the passage focuses on the specific, tragic result of their unfulfilled dream."}
