{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, Emily Bront\u00eb delves into the destructive nature of love through the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Their passionate and obsessive relationship is filled with both tenderness and cruelty. Catherine's marriage to Edgar Linton creates a rift between her and Heathcliff, yet she continues to long for him. _____, despite their estrangement, Heathcliff\u2019s love for Catherine remains all-consuming, and he seeks revenge on those he holds responsible for her suffering.", "A": "For example", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In addition", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Catherine\u2019s marriage to Edgar and the enduring, destructive nature of Heathcliff\u2019s love for her. It highlights that despite the physical separation and emotional distance, Heathcliff\u2019s feelings remain as intense as ever.\nA) For example would incorrectly suggest that Heathcliff\u2019s emotions are just an illustration of a broader theme, whereas the passage is focusing on the complexity of his unresolved love for Catherine.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is emphasizing the emotional contradiction between separation and obsession, not a straightforward result.\nD) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Heathcliff's feelings are another added point, but the passage is more about the contradiction between his suffering and his ongoing desire for vengeance and love."}
