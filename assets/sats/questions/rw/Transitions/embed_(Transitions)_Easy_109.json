{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley explores the theme of unchecked ambition through the character of Victor Frankenstein. Victor becomes consumed with the desire to transcend the limitations of human life by creating life itself. _____, his creation is monstrous and unlovable, and his inability to accept responsibility for his actions leads to a spiral of guilt, fear, and ultimately, tragedy.", "A": "For example", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "In contrast", "D": "As a result", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: As A Result\nThe correct answer, \"As a result,\" emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship between Victor\u2019s obsession with creating life and the tragic consequences that follow. It logically connects his actions to the outcome described in the sentence.\nA) For example would imply that the sentence is giving an example, but it is focusing on a direct consequence, not an illustration.\nB) Nevertheless would suggest a contradiction, but the passage is about a direct result, not an opposition.\nD) In contrast would imply a comparison, which doesn\u2019t fit the cause-and-effect nature of the passage."}
