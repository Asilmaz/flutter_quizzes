{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the consequences of sin and guilt through the character of Hester Prynne, who is publicly shamed for committing adultery. Throughout the novel, Hester faces the harsh judgment of society but remains strong, refusing to reveal the identity of her lover. _____, as Hester reflects on her past actions, she begins to find peace in her own strength and the support of her daughter, Pearl.", "A": "However", "B": "In addition", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Hester\u2019s public shame and her internal growth. It emphasizes that despite the harsh judgment and external suffering, she finds peace and strength, highlighting a shift in her character.\nA) For example would imply that the sentence is providing an illustration of something broader, but the passage is about Hester\u2019s internal reflection, not an example.\nB) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Hester\u2019s peace is simply an added point, but the passage emphasizes a significant shift in her character in the face of hardship.\nC) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is not focused on an immediate result; it\u2019s more about Hester\u2019s internal change despite external pressures."}
