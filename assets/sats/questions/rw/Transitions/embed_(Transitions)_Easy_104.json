{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>1984</em>, George Orwell presents a dystopian society controlled by the Party, where individuality is crushed and truth is manipulated. Winston Smith, the protagonist, works for the Ministry of Truth, falsifying historical records to align with the Party's propaganda. _____, despite his deep dissatisfaction with the regime, Winston initially believes that his private rebellion, in the form of a diary, will remain a secret and have no consequence.", "A": "For example", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "In addition", "D": "Consequently", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Winston\u2019s belief that his small act of rebellion will be inconsequential and the reality that it ultimately leads to his capture and punishment. It emphasizes the contradiction between his personal hope and the oppressive power of the Party.\nA) For example would imply that Winston\u2019s belief in the safety of his diary is an illustration of something broader, which is not the intended meaning.\nC) In addition would suggest that Winston\u2019s belief in secrecy is an additional point, which doesn\u2019t align with the idea of his mistaken belief leading to a tragic consequence.\nD) Consequently would suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage focuses more on Winston\u2019s misjudgment of the regime\u2019s power."}
