{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Jane Austen explores the theme of love and marriage through the contrasting characters of Elizabeth Bennet and Charlotte Lucas. While Elizabeth values mutual respect and emotional connection in a marriage, Charlotte accepts a proposal from Mr. Collins purely for security. _____, Elizabeth\u2019s refusal to marry Mr. Collins emphasizes her belief in love as the foundation of a successful marriage, even at the cost of financial stability.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "Therefore", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Elizabeth\u2019s rejection of Mr. Collins and her insistence on love as the basis for marriage. It highlights the strength of her beliefs, despite the practical considerations that Charlotte takes into account.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s refusal is an additional point to be considered, but the focus is on the contradiction between Elizabeth\u2019s ideals and the realities of social expectations.\nB) Therefore would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s refusal is a result of something mentioned earlier, but the passage is about her decision based on principle, not a logical consequence.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is offering an illustration, but the passage is emphasizing Elizabeth's strong personal choice, not just an example of her values."}
