Salinger follows Holden Caulfield, a teenager struggling with the complexities of growing up. Holden is disillusioned by the \"phoniness\" of the adult world and seeks to preserve the innocence of childhood. _____, despite his desire to protect innocence, he ultimately cannot escape the adult world, and his journey reflects his internal battle between innocence and the harsh realities of life.", "A": "In contrast", "B": "Consequently", "C": "For example", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Holden\u2019s desire to preserve innocence and the reality of his inability to avoid growing up. It highlights the tension between his ideals and the inevitable process of maturation.\nA) In contrast would imply a sharper opposition between two completely separate ideas, which is not the intended meaning. The passage focuses on the contradiction within Holden's own internal struggle.\nB) Consequently would suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which doesn\u2019t capture the ongoing tension Holden feels.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is offering an illustration, which doesn\u2019t fit the context of the passage, which focuses on Holden\u2019s contradictory emotions."}
