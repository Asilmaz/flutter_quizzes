{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, F. Scott Fitzgerald portrays the tragic consequences of unfulfilled dreams and reckless ambition. Jay Gatsby dedicates his life to recreating the past and winning back Daisy Buchanan, believing his wealth and status will make his dream a reality. _____, Gatsby\u2019s relentless pursuit of an idealized future blinds him to the reality of Daisy\u2019s character and the impossibility of reclaiming the past.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "However", "C": "For example", "D": "Despite this", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" establishes a contrast between Gatsby\u2019s dedication to his dream and the eventual realization that his efforts are futile. The transition emphasizes the gap between his ambitions and the harsh realities he refuses to acknowledge.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly suggest that Gatsby\u2019s pursuit directly leads to the realization, which does not reflect the contrast between his beliefs and the reality.\nB) Despite this might seem tempting but suggests an opposition rather than highlighting the nuanced contrast of his ambition and blindness.\nC) For example would incorrectly indicate the sentence is providing a specific illustration, which is not the intent of the passage."}
