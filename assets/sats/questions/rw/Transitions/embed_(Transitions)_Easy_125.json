{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, J.D. Salinger presents Holden Caulfield as a deeply disillusioned teenager who feels alienated from the world around him. Throughout the novel, Holden rejects the adult world, which he views as \"phony.\" _____, he forms a close bond with his younger sister, Phoebe, who represents the innocence and honesty Holden longs to protect, showing that he is not entirely without empathy.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Holden's rejection of the adult world and his love for his sister Phoebe. It emphasizes the complexity of Holden\u2019s character, as he both criticizes the world around him yet still cares deeply for someone who represents innocence.\nA) In addition would suggest that Holden\u2019s bond with Phoebe is simply another point being added, but it doesn\u2019t capture the contradiction between his cynicism and his tenderness.\nC) Consequently would imply a cause-and-effect relationship, but Holden's affection for Phoebe isn't directly caused by his disillusionment; rather, it's a more complex, contrasting aspect of his character.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Holden\u2019s relationship with Phoebe is just an illustration of a broader point, but the passage is focused on the internal contradiction within Holden."}
