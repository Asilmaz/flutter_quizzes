{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, F. Scott Fitzgerald explores the theme of the American Dream through the character of Jay Gatsby, who amasses great wealth in an attempt to win back Daisy Buchanan, the woman he loves. Gatsby's extravagant parties and ostentatious lifestyle are meant to impress Daisy and prove his worthiness. _____, despite his wealth and the grandeur of his life, Gatsby cannot recreate the past, and his dream of being with Daisy remains unfulfilled, revealing the inherent futility of his pursuit.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "However", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Gatsby\u2019s material success and his failure to achieve his dream. It highlights the irony that, despite all his efforts and wealth, Gatsby\u2019s pursuit of Daisy is ultimately in vain.\nA) Consequently would suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is more about the contrast between Gatsby\u2019s outward success and his inner failure to reclaim his past.\nB) In addition would incorrectly imply that Gatsby\u2019s failure to recreate the past is an added point, whereas the passage focuses on the contradiction between his success and his inability to fulfill his dream.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Gatsby\u2019s failure is an illustration, but the passage emphasizes the tension between his achievements and the futility of his pursuit."}
