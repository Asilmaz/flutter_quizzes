{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, Emily Bront\u00eb examines the destructive effects of love and revenge through the relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff's intense bond is marred by bitterness and cruelty, but they are unable to let go of one another. _____, despite the passion they share, their love ultimately becomes toxic and leads to their mutual destruction, with each suffering from their inability to let go of the past.", "A": "Despite this", "B": "Similarly", "C": "Consequently", "D": "In contrast", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice A: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" highlights the cause-and-effect relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff's obsessive love and their eventual downfall. It emphasizes how their inability to move past their mutual bitterness results in destruction.\nB) Similarly would incorrectly suggest a comparison, while the sentence is describing the inevitable consequences of their actions.\nC) Despite this would imply that their love somehow contradicts the destructive outcome, which does not fit the intended meaning of the passage.\nD) In contrast would suggest a comparison between two separate ideas, which does not align with the cause-and-effect nature of the sentence."}
