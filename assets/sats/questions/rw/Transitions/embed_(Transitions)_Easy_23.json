{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "Gregor Mendel, often regarded as the father of genetics, conducted experiments with pea plants to uncover the principles of inheritance. His meticulous work revealed the predictable patterns of dominant and recessive traits. _____ Mendel\u2019s findings were not widely recognized during his lifetime, gaining significance only decades later when other scientists rediscovered his research.", "A": "Similarly", "B": "However", "C": "Therefore", "D": "Previously", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" establishes a contrast between Mendel\u2019s groundbreaking discoveries and the lack of recognition they received during his lifetime. This transition emphasizes the opposition between his work\u2019s importance and the initial response to it.\nB) Similarly would imply a continuation or comparison, which does not align with the contrast being made between Mendel\u2019s discoveries and their delayed recognition.\nC) Therefore would imply causation, suggesting that Mendel's lack of recognition was a result of his discoveries, which is illogical.\nD) Previously would signal an earlier time, which does not fit the contrast being described between Mendel's work and its later acknowledgment."}
