{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Harper Lee examines the impact of racism on the residents of Maycomb, Alabama, through the trial of Tom Robinson, an African American man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch, Robinson\u2019s lawyer, presents a compelling defense, showing that the evidence does not support the charges. _____, despite the clear lack of evidence and Atticus's persuasive argument, the jury convicts Tom Robinson, revealing the deeply ingrained racial prejudices that influence the justice system.", "A": "Nevertheless", "B": "In addition", "C": "As a result", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between the lack of evidence and the jury\u2019s decision to convict Tom Robinson. It emphasizes the irony that, despite the compelling defense, racial bias prevails and leads to an unjust verdict.\nA) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, which does not fit with the contrast between the trial\u2019s evidence and the outcome.\nC) As a result would incorrectly suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage focuses on the contradiction between evidence and the racial bias that influences the decision.\nD) For example would imply that the sentence is providing an illustration, but the passage is more focused on the contradiction, not an example of the situation."}
