{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, F. Scott Fitzgerald explores the theme of the American Dream through the life of Jay Gatsby, a man who rises from humble beginnings to great wealth in pursuit of a dream. Gatsby\u2019s lavish parties and extravagant lifestyle are all part of his plan to win back Daisy Buchanan, the woman he loves. _____, despite his success and wealth, Gatsby is ultimately unable to rekindle his past relationship with Daisy, revealing the emptiness at the heart of his dream.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "For example", "D": "Nevertheless", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Gatsby\u2019s outward success and his inability to achieve his dream. It highlights the irony that, despite all his wealth and efforts, Gatsby fails to recapture the past, showing the futility of his pursuit.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Gatsby\u2019s failure to reclaim Daisy is another detail, when the passage is focused on the contrast between his material success and the emotional void he experiences.\nB) Consequently would imply that Gatsby\u2019s inability to win back Daisy is a direct result of his actions, but the passage is about the contradiction between his achievements and his inability to fulfill his dream, not a simple cause-and-effect.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the sentence is offering an illustration, but the passage emphasizes the contradiction between Gatsby\u2019s wealth and the lack of fulfillment in his life."}
