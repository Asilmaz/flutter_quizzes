{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Harper Lee explores themes of prejudice and justice through the trial of Tom Robinson. Atticus Finch, Robinson\u2019s lawyer, defends him with integrity, presenting clear evidence of his innocence. _____, despite Atticus\u2019s efforts, the jury convicts Robinson, demonstrating the deep-seated racial biases in the town of Maycomb.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "However", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Atticus\u2019s strong defense of Tom Robinson and the jury's unjust conviction of him. It highlights the contradiction between the truth presented in the trial and the outcome shaped by racial prejudice.\nB) Consequently would incorrectly imply that the jury\u2019s conviction was a natural result of Atticus\u2019s defense, which is not the intended meaning.\nC) In addition would suggest an additive relationship, which doesn\u2019t fit the sentence\u2019s focus on a contrasting situation.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is illustrating a point, but the focus is on the outcome of the trial, not providing an example."}
