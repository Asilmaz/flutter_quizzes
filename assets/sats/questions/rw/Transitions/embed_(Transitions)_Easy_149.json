Dorian Gray, a handsome young man, becomes increasingly obsessed with his own beauty, while his portrait ages in his place, reflecting the corrupting effects of his hedonistic lifestyle. _____, despite the outward appearance of youth and innocence, Dorian\u2019s portrait reveals the true decay of his soul, highlighting the moral consequences of his actions.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "For example", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Dorian\u2019s external beauty and the corruption shown in his portrait. It highlights the irony that, despite his physical perfection, his internal moral decay is revealed through the portrait, which serves as a metaphor for the consequences of his actions.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Dorian's portrait is just an added point, when in fact it\u2019s the source of the passage's contrast\u2014his outward beauty versus inner corruption.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is not simply showing a result; it\u2019s emphasizing the contrast between appearance and reality.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the portrait is an illustration of a broader point, but the passage is focused on the contradiction between Dorian\u2019s external youth and his internal decay."}
