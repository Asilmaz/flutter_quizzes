{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Jane Austen explores themes of love, class, and personal growth. Elizabeth Bennet initially forms a negative opinion of Mr. Darcy, believing him to be arrogant and dismissive. _____, as she comes to understand his true character and the sacrifices he has made for others, Elizabeth begins to see him in a new light, challenging her initial prejudices.", "A": "Similarly", "B": "However", "C": "Because of", "D": "In addition", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice A: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" establishes a contrast between Elizabeth\u2019s initial negative impression of Darcy and her eventual realization of his true character. It highlights the shift in her perspective as she gains more insight.\nB) Similarly would suggest a comparison, which does not align with the contrast presented in the sentence.\nC) Because of would incorrectly imply that Elizabeth\u2019s realization directly caused her initial negative opinion, which does not fit the context.\nD) In addition would imply that her understanding builds on her initial opinion, which is contradictory to the transformative nature of her change in perspective."}
