Despite her initial prejudice against Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth eventually comes to appreciate his true nature and moral integrity. _____, her change in opinion comes only after she learns of his actions to protect her sister Lydia, revealing that her judgment was initially clouded by her own pride.", "A": "However", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In contrast", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Elizabeth\u2019s initial judgment of Mr. Darcy and her eventual change of opinion. It shows that despite her negative assumptions about him, she recognizes his true worth after learning more about his character.\nA) In contrast would imply a comparison between two different ideas, which is not the focus of the passage.\nB) Consequently would incorrectly suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is about a shift in Elizabeth's understanding, not a direct result of her actions.\nD) For example would incorrectly imply that the sentence is offering an illustration, but it focuses on a change in Elizabeth\u2019s perception rather than an example."}
