	"C": "As a result",
	"D": "Meanwhile",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Correct choice C: \"As a result.\" Her successful desert crossing allowed her to document stunning images and stories from the Sahara, so a cause-and-effect transition is apt. \"Nevertheless\" would suggest an unexpected twist, \"Instead\" suggests replacing one action with another, and \"Meanwhile\" focuses on simultaneity rather than outcome."
