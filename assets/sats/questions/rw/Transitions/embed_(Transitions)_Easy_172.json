{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the theme of sin and guilt through the character of Hester Prynne, who is publicly shamed for having a child out of wedlock. Hester is forced to wear the scarlet letter \u201cA\u201d as a mark of her sin, yet she refuses to reveal the name of the father. _____, as time passes, Hester grows stronger and more independent, using her position in the community to help others and transforming the symbol of shame into one of dignity.", "A": "Nevertheless", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Hester\u2019s initial shame and her eventual empowerment. It highlights the irony that, despite being publicly condemned for her sin, Hester turns the scarlet letter from a symbol of disgrace into one of strength and respect.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Hester\u2019s transformation is just another added point, when the passage is focused on the contrast between her initial punishment and her later dignity.\nB) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is about the shift from Hester\u2019s shame to her strength, not simply a result of her situation.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that the passage is illustrating a broader concept, but it is focused on Hester's personal transformation in response to her circumstances."}
