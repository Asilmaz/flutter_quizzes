{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Animal Farm</em>, George Orwell presents a satirical allegory about the rise of totalitarianism. The animals on Manor Farm overthrow their human owner, Mr. Jones, and take control of the farm, establishing their own government. _____, as the pigs assume leadership, they gradually become as corrupt and oppressive as the humans they overthrew, demonstrating the corrupting influence of power.", "A": "In addition", "B": "For example", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "Consequently", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Consequently\nThe correct answer, \"Consequently,\" shows the cause-and-effect relationship between the animals\u2019 revolution and the eventual corruption of their leadership. The pigs\u2019 rise to power results directly in their transformation into the very thing they had initially rebelled against, emphasizing the theme of power corrupting absolutely.\nA) In addition would suggest that the pigs\u2019 corruption is an additional point, but the passage focuses on how their actions directly lead to the same oppressive behavior they initially opposed.\nC) Nevertheless would imply a contrast, but the passage is focused on the inevitability of the pigs' corruption rather than a contradiction between their ideals and actions.\nD) For example would suggest that the pigs\u2019 actions are merely an illustration of a broader point, but the passage is about the direct consequence of their rise to power."}
