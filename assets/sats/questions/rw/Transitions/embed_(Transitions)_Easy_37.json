Carton begins the novel as a disillusioned and apathetic man, seemingly without purpose or direction. _____, his selfless act of sacrificing his life for Charles Darnay reveals his capacity for deep love and redemption, marking a profound transformation in his character.", "A": "However", "B": "Similarly", "C": "As a result", "D": "Despite this", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Sydney Carton\u2019s initial indifference and his ultimate act of heroism. The transition emphasizes the significant change in his character over the course of the novel.\nA) As a result would incorrectly imply that Carton\u2019s selfless act was a direct outcome of his disillusionment, which is not the focus of the sentence.\nB) Similarly suggests a comparison, which does not align with the contrasting ideas of Carton\u2019s transformation.\nD) Despite this could be tempting but would not fit as smoothly, as it would imply a conflict between his early apathy and later heroism rather than highlighting the contrast."}
