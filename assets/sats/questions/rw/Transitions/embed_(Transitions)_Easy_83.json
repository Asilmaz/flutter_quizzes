{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, John Steinbeck portrays the Joad family\u2019s struggle to survive during the Great Depression. As they travel westward in search of a better life, they encounter harsh conditions, exploitation, and prejudice. _____, despite these challenges, they maintain a sense of hope and determination, driven by the belief that a better future is possible.", "A": "As a result", "B": "Consequently", "C": "However", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between the harsh realities the Joad family faces and their continued hope and determination. It highlights the resilience of the family in the face of adversity.\nA) As a result would suggest that their hope and determination were a direct consequence of the challenges they faced, which does not align with the passage\u2019s focus on their inner strength despite the difficulties.\nC) Consequently would imply a cause-and-effect relationship, which does not reflect the contrast in the sentence.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest the sentence is providing an illustration, which is not the intent of the passage."}
