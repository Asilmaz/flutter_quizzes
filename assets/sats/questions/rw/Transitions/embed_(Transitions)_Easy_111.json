{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Charlotte Bront\u00eb explores themes of independence and self-respect through the character of Jane, who faces many personal and societal challenges. After Jane finds out the truth about Mr. Rochester's past, she is faced with a moral dilemma. _____, despite her deep feelings for him, Jane chooses to leave, unwilling to compromise her own dignity for the sake of love.", "A": "As a result", "B": "Nevertheless", "C": "In contrast", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Jane's love for Mr. Rochester and her decision to leave him in order to maintain her self-respect. It emphasizes that despite her emotions, her principles take precedence.\nA) As a result would incorrectly suggest that Jane\u2019s decision to leave is a direct consequence of the revelation, while the passage focuses more on the internal conflict she faces.\nB) In contrast would imply a stronger opposition between two different ideas, but the passage is about Jane's decision despite her love, not a direct comparison.\nD) For example would suggest that the sentence is offering an illustration, but the focus here is on Jane's personal decision, not an example of a broader concept."}
