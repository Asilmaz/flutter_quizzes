{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Harper Lee highlights the deep-seated racism in the American South during the 1930s through the trial of Tom Robinson, an African American man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch, Robinson\u2019s lawyer, presents a compelling case, proving that the evidence does not support the charges. _____, despite the clear lack of evidence, the jury convicts Tom Robinson, illustrating the extent of racial prejudice in the justice system.", "A": "In addition", "B": "Consequently", "C": "Nevertheless", "D": "For example", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice B: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between the evidence in favor of Robinson\u2019s innocence and the jury\u2019s decision to convict him. It emphasizes the irony that, despite the lack of proof, the conviction happens due to racial prejudice.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that the jury\u2019s decision is an additional point, when the passage emphasizes the contrast between the lack of evidence and the conviction.\nC) Consequently would imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which does not reflect the contrast between the lack of evidence and the conviction based on prejudice.\nD) For example would suggest the sentence is offering an illustration, which is not the intent of the passage. The sentence focuses on the contradiction, not providing an example of a broader point."}
