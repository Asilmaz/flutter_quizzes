{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, J.D. Salinger portrays Holden Caulfield as a disaffected teenager who feels disconnected from society. Holden\u2019s cynicism toward the world is reflected in his constant criticism of people around him, whom he describes as \u201cphony.\u201d _____, despite his harsh judgments, Holden\u2019s deep loneliness and desire for connection are evident throughout the novel, revealing that his alienation stems more from fear and insecurity than from any real disdain for others.", "A": "For example", "B": "In addition", "C": "Consequently", "D": "However", "correct": "D", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Holden's harsh criticisms of others and his underlying loneliness and need for connection. It emphasizes the irony that, despite Holden's outward cynicism, his behavior is rooted in deeper feelings of fear and insecurity.\nA) For example would incorrectly suggest that Holden\u2019s loneliness is simply an illustration of a broader point, but the passage is focused on the contradiction between his outward hostility and internal vulnerability.\nB) In addition would imply that Holden's loneliness is just another point to consider, while the passage highlights the contrast between his cynicism and his need for connection.\nD) Consequently would suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, but the passage is about the tension between Holden's judgments and his inner feelings, not a direct result of his criticisms."}
