{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, Emily Bront\u00eb portrays the passionate and tumultuous relationship between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. They share a deep bond that is both destructive and obsessive, which leads to great emotional suffering for both. _____, Catherine\u2019s eventual marriage to Edgar Linton causes her inner conflict, as she is torn between her love for Heathcliff and the stability offered by Edgar.", "A": "Consequently", "B": "Despite this", "C": "In contrast", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Despite This\nThe correct answer, \"Despite this,\" introduces a contrast between Catherine\u2019s conflicting emotions. Even though she marries Edgar for stability, she is still deeply torn by her love for Heathcliff, which illustrates her internal struggle.\nA) Consequently would incorrectly suggest that her marriage to Edgar is a direct result of her love for Heathcliff, while the passage emphasizes the conflict and emotional turmoil caused by the choice.\nB) In contrast would imply a stronger opposition than is intended. The passage is more about the internal conflict within Catherine, not a sharp contrast between two unrelated ideas.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Catherine\u2019s marriage is an illustration of a broader point, whereas the focus is on her personal emotional dilemma."}
