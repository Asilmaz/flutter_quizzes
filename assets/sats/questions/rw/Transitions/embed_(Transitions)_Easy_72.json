Elizabeth initially judges Mr. Darcy harshly, based on his aloof behavior and proud nature. _____, as she learns more about his true character and the reasons behind his actions, Elizabeth begins to appreciate his integrity and changes her view of him.", "A": "However", "B": "Despite this", "C": "As a result", "D": "Therefore", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Elizabeth\u2019s initial judgment of Darcy and her eventual change in perception. It highlights the shift in her attitude toward him as she uncovers the truth about his character.\nA) Therefore would imply that Elizabeth\u2019s change in opinion was a logical conclusion drawn from earlier information, but it doesn\u2019t fully capture the contrast in her evolving perception.\nB) Despite this suggests a contradiction, but the sentence is about a progression in Elizabeth\u2019s understanding, not an opposition.\nC) As a result would suggest a cause-and-effect relationship that oversimplifies Elizabeth\u2019s gradual shift in perspective."}
