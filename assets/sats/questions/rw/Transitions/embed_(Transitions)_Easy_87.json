{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Jane Austen portrays Elizabeth Bennet as a strong-willed and independent woman who values personal integrity over social status. Elizabeth initially rejects Mr. Darcy's proposal because of his arrogance and her belief that he has wronged her sister. _____, as Elizabeth learns more about Darcy's true character and the reasons behind his actions, she begins to see him in a new light, and they eventually form a strong emotional connection.", "A": "As a result", "B": "However", "C": "In contrast", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Elizabeth\u2019s initial judgment of Darcy and her eventual change of heart. It emphasizes the shift in her perception, showing that despite her initial misjudgment, she comes to understand and appreciate his true character.\nA) As a result would incorrectly suggest that Elizabeth\u2019s change in opinion is a direct outcome of Darcy's actions, which oversimplifies the situation.\nB) In contrast would imply a direct opposition between her initial views and the new perception, but the transition is more about a gradual shift than an outright contrast.\nD) For example would imply an illustration of a broader point, which is not the purpose of this sentence."}
