Initially, Pip is ashamed of his humble origins and desires to become a gentleman to win Estella\u2019s love. _____, as he matures, he begins to understand that true worth lies not in social status but in kindness and integrity.", "A": "For example", "B": "In contrast", "C": "However", "D": "As a result", "correct": "C", "explanation": "Correct choice D: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between Pip\u2019s initial pursuit of wealth and status and his later realization of what truly matters. It highlights the shift in Pip's values from superficial desires to moral growth.\nA) For example would imply that the sentence is providing an illustration, which does not fit the context of Pip\u2019s evolving character.\nB) In contrast would suggest a sharper opposition, which doesn\u2019t fully capture the change in Pip\u2019s perspective over time.\nC) As a result would imply that his maturation is a direct consequence of his initial pursuit of social status, but the passage emphasizes a gradual shift in his moral understanding."}
