{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Charlotte Bront\u00eb portrays the titular character as a strong, independent woman who values her self-respect above all. Jane\u2019s moral integrity is tested when she falls in love with Mr. Rochester, but she is forced to make a difficult choice when she discovers he is hiding a dark secret. _____, despite her feelings for him, Jane decides to leave Thornfield, unwilling to compromise her values for the sake of love, and seeks a life of independence.", "A": "Nevertheless", "B": "Consequently", "C": "In addition", "D": "For example", "correct": "A", "explanation": "Correct choice C: Nevertheless\nThe correct answer, \"Nevertheless,\" introduces a contrast between Jane's deep love for Mr. Rochester and her decision to leave him in order to maintain her self-respect. It highlights that, despite the emotional cost, Jane chooses her principles over her feelings, demonstrating her inner strength.\nA) In addition would incorrectly suggest that Jane\u2019s decision is an added point to something that came before, while the passage is focused on a contrast between her love and her values.\nB) Consequently would imply that her decision to leave Mr. Rochester is a direct result of something earlier in the passage, but the sentence is about the emotional conflict and Jane's choice to stay true to her beliefs.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Jane's decision is simply an illustration, but the passage is emphasizing her strong moral decision, not providing an example of a broader theme."}
