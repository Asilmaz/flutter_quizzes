{"introduction": "", "question": "Read the passage below and choose the most appropriate transition word or phrase to fill in the blank.", "text": "In <em>Brave New World</em>, Aldous Huxley depicts a dystopian society in which happiness is achieved through conformity and the use of a drug called soma. The citizens of this society are conditioned from birth to accept their roles and to avoid any form of discomfort or dissatisfaction. _____, Bernard Marx, a member of the ruling class, begins to question the society\u2019s values and yearns for individual freedom, despite the pressure to conform to the collective mindset.", "A": "In addition", "B": "However", "C": "Consequently", "D": "For example", "correct": "B", "explanation": "Correct choice C: However\nThe correct answer, \"However,\" introduces a contrast between the society\u2019s values of conformity and Bernard Marx\u2019s internal struggle. It highlights that, despite living in a society that discourages individual thought, Bernard still experiences a desire for personal freedom, showcasing the tension between individualism and societal control.\nA) In addition would imply that Bernard\u2019s questioning is an additional point, while the passage is focused on the contrast between his internal conflict and the society\u2019s demands for conformity.\nB) Consequently would suggest that Bernard\u2019s yearning for freedom is a result of the societal pressures, but the passage emphasizes the conflict between his desires and the society\u2019s expectations, not a direct cause-and-effect.\nD) For example would incorrectly suggest that Bernard\u2019s questioning is simply an illustration, whereas the passage is focused on the tension between his individual desires and the collective society."}
