{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking (1988).", "text": "Hawking examines the evolution of scientific theories about the universe, focusing on breakthroughs in cosmology and quantum mechanics. Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity ______ scientists to better understand the nature of gravity and predict phenomena like black holes and gravitational waves.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative of the passage.", "A": "allowed", "B": "has allowed", "C": "allowing", "D": "allows", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has allowed connects the historical development of general relativity to its ongoing relevance in modern scientific studies, emphasizing its lasting influence.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allowed confines the action to the past, failing to emphasize its continuing significance.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allows implies that the action is happening currently, which disrupts the historical narrative."}
