{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration</em> by Isabel Wilkerson (2010).", "text": "Wilkerson chronicles the migration of African Americans from the rural South to urban areas in the North and West during the 20th century. She describes how millions sought opportunities in industrial cities, leaving behind the oppressive Jim Crow laws. These migrants often faced significant challenges, but their determination ______ a profound impact on the cultural and economic landscapes of their new communities.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the sentence's alignment with the historical and narrative context.", "A": "having", "B": "has had", "C": "had", "D": "have", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has had appropriately reflects the continuing influence of the Great Migration on modern society while maintaining subject-verb agreement with the singular subject determination.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the participle having does not form a complete verb for the main clause, resulting in an incomplete sentence.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the past tense had suggests the impact is confined to the past, which does not align with the ongoing effects described in the broader context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the plural verb have does not agree with the singular subject determination."}
