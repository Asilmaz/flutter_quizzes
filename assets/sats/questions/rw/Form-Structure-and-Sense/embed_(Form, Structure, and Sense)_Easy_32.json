{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Botany of Desire: A Plant\u2019s-Eye View of the World</em> by Michael Pollan (2001).", "text": "Pollan examines the complex relationships between humans and plants, exploring how plants have evolved to meet human desires while humans cultivate and spread them. He uses the example of the tulip, which, during the 17th-century Dutch tulip mania, became a symbol of beauty and wealth. This period of fascination with the flower ______ the extent to which human culture can influence the natural world.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay careful attention to verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and the sentence\u2019s logical alignment with the historical context.", "A": "has illustrated", "B": "illustrate", "C": "illustrating", "D": "illustrates", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The singular verb illustrates agrees with the singular subject period and fits the present tense narrative that reflects a general truth about the influence of human culture on nature.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the plural verb illustrate does not agree with the singular subject period.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle illustrating does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has illustrated suggests a connection to the present moment, which is unnecessary given the historical focus of the example."}
