{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</em> by Doris Kearns Goodwin (2005).", "text": "Goodwin explores how Abraham Lincoln\u2019s leadership style brought together a cabinet of individuals with opposing views, creating an atmosphere of vigorous debate and collaboration. This strategy ______ critical during the Civil War, enabling Lincoln to navigate the nation through one of its most challenging periods while fostering unity among disparate factions.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense aligns with the historical context and contributes to the logical flow of the sentence.", "A": "has proven", "B": "proves", "C": "proving", "D": "proved", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has proven reflects the enduring relevance of Lincoln\u2019s leadership style while acknowledging its importance during the Civil War.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense proves implies the action is happening now, which does not align with the historical narrative.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because proving does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the past tense proved limits the action to the past, failing to capture its ongoing significance."}
