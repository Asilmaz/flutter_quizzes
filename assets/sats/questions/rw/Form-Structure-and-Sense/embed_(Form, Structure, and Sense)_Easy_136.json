{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</em> by Doris Kearns Goodwin (2005).", "text": "Goodwin explores Abraham Lincoln\u2019s leadership during the Civil War, focusing on his ability to unite a divided nation. By assembling a cabinet of opposing viewpoints, Lincoln ______ an unprecedented strategy for navigating political and military challenges, ultimately preserving the Union.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and political context of the passage.", "A": "devises", "B": "devising", "C": "devised", "D": "has devised", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense devised accurately reflects Lincoln\u2019s historical actions during the Civil War, describing his leadership as a completed action.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because devises implies that the action is occurring now, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because devising does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has devised unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required in this context."}
