{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2010).", "text": "Mukherjee describes the transformative impact of chemotherapy in the fight against cancer, a treatment approach first tested in the mid-20th century. These early experiments ______ the foundation for modern cancer treatments, leading to the development of drugs that target specific cellular pathways.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative of the passage.", "A": "laid", "B": "laying", "C": "has laid", "D": "lays", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid accurately reflects the historical context of the initial chemotherapy experiments and their foundational role in cancer treatment advancements.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has laid unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical focus.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because lays implies the action is happening now, disrupting the historical narrative."}
