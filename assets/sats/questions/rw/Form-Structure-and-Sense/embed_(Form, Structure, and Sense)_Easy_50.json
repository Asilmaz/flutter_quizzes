{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wright Brothers</em> by David McCullough (2015).", "text": "McCullough details the determination and ingenuity of Orville and Wilbur Wright in creating the first successful airplane. Their rigorous testing of wing designs and engines led to the historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. This achievement ______ the beginning of a new era in transportation, forever changing the way humans interact with the world.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the sentence\u2019s alignment with the historical context.", "A": "marking", "B": "has marked", "C": "marks", "D": "marked", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense marked appropriately reflects the historical context of the Wright brothers\u2019 achievement and its significance in history.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle marking does not provide a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has marked implies a connection to the present, which is unnecessary given the historical focus of the passage.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present tense marks incorrectly suggests that the event is occurring now rather than in the past."}
