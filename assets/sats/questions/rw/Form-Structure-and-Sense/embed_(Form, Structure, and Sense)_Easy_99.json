{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Cosmos</em> by Carl Sagan (1980).", "text": "Sagan reflects on humanity\u2019s quest to understand the universe, emphasizing the role of scientific inquiry and discovery. The invention of the telescope in the 17th century ______ astronomers to observe distant galaxies and explore the vastness of space, transforming our understanding of the cosmos.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb fits within the historical and scientific context of the passage.", "A": "allowing", "B": "has allowed", "C": "allows", "D": "allowed", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed appropriately reflects the historical invention of the telescope as a completed event that revolutionized astronomy during that era.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies the action is happening currently, disrupting the historical narrative."}
