{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel explores the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician who profoundly influenced number theory. Despite having little formal training, Ramanujan\u2019s work ______ new areas of mathematical research, inspiring generations of mathematicians to explore complex theories and patterns.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative of the passage.", "A": "inspires", "B": "inspiring", "C": "inspired", "D": "has inspired", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense inspired accurately reflects the historical context of Ramanujan\u2019s contributions while also leaving room for their lasting significance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because inspires implies that the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because inspiring does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has inspired unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for this context."}
