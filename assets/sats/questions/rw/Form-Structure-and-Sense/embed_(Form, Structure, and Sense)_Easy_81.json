{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</em> by Doris Kearns Goodwin (2005).", "text": "Goodwin examines how Abraham Lincoln brought together political rivals to form a cabinet during the Civil War. By fostering collaboration and debate among opposing viewpoints, Lincoln ______ a strategy that allowed him to navigate the nation through its most challenging moments while preserving unity and integrity.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical flow of the historical narrative.", "A": "crafting", "B": "crafts", "C": "has crafted", "D": "crafted", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense crafted aligns with the historical narrative, describing Lincoln\u2019s actions as completed events during his presidency.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because crafting does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence grammatically incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has crafted suggests an unnecessary connection to the present, which is not relevant in the historical focus of the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because crafts is in the present tense, which incorrectly implies that Lincoln\u2019s strategy is occurring now."}
