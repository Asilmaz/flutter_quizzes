{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2016).", "text": "Mukherjee traces the history of genetic research, from Gregor Mendel\u2019s early experiments with pea plants to the discovery of the structure of DNA. The understanding of DNA ______ scientists to decode genetic information, revolutionizing medicine and biology.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative of the passage.", "A": "has allowed", "B": "allows", "C": "allowed", "D": "allowing", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present tense allows reflects the ongoing impact of the discovery of DNA on current scientific research, emphasizing its continued relevance in modern genetics.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because has allowed ties the action to the present but also emphasizes completion, which is less effective for the ongoing process.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because allowed confines the action to the past, failing to highlight its continuous significance.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
