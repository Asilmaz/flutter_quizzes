{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wright Brothers</em> by David McCullough (2015).", "text": "McCullough describes the Wright brothers\u2019 innovative experiments that culminated in the first successful powered flight. Their groundbreaking work ______ the development of modern aviation, transforming transportation and revolutionizing the way people connect across the globe.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical alignment of the sentence with the historical narrative.", "A": "lays", "B": "laid", "C": "has laid", "D": "laying", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid aligns with the historical focus of the sentence, describing the Wright brothers\u2019 contributions as completed actions that established the foundation for modern aviation.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because lays is in the present tense, which disrupts the historical context by suggesting the action is occurring now.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has laid unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not relevant to the historical narrative.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
