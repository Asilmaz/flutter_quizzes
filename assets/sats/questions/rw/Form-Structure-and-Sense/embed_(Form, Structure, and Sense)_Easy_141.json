{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</em> by Dava Sobel (1995).", "text": "Sobel chronicles John Harrison\u2019s invention of the marine chronometer, a tool that revolutionized navigation by providing accurate measurements of longitude. This innovation ______ the era of precise maritime exploration, reducing the risk of shipwrecks and enabling global trade routes to flourish.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and technological context.", "A": "began", "B": "beginning", "C": "has begun", "D": "begins", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense began accurately reflects the historical nature of Harrison\u2019s invention and its immediate impact during its time.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because begins implies the action is happening now, which disrupts the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because beginning does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has begun unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not relevant to the historical narrative."}
