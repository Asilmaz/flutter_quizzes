{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em> by Walter Isaacson (2014).", "text": "Isaacson highlights the collaboration and innovation that defined the early days of the computing revolution. The invention of the microprocessor, a compact and powerful device, ______ computing by making it possible to create personal computers and portable devices, fundamentally transforming industries and lifestyles.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense and structure align with the sentence\u2019s historical and technological context.", "A": "transforms", "B": "transforming", "C": "transformed", "D": "has transformed", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense transformed correctly reflects the historical impact of the microprocessor, describing how it revolutionized computing as a completed event.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because transforms is in the present tense, which disrupts the historical narrative by suggesting the transformation is happening now.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because transforming does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has transformed unnecessarily connects the historical event to the present, which is not required in this context."}
