{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wright Brothers</em> by David McCullough (2015).", "text": "McCullough highlights the innovation and determination of Orville and Wilbur Wright as they worked to create the first successful airplane. Their systematic experiments and relentless pursuit of improvement ______ the foundation for modern aviation, leading to advancements that transformed global transportation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical relationship of the action to the historical context.", "A": "provides", "B": "has provided", "C": "providing", "D": "provided", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense provided reflects the historical nature of the Wright brothers\u2019 achievements and their influence on the development of modern aviation.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because provides is in the present tense, which disrupts the historical narrative by implying the action is occurring now.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has provided unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not required given the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because providing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
