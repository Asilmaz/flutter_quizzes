{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A People\u2019s History of the United States</em> by Howard Zinn (1980).", "text": "Zinn presents an alternative view of American history, focusing on the struggles of marginalized groups. He examines the labor movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where workers protested poor conditions and demanded fair treatment. The strikes of this era ______ the foundation for many of the labor protections now taken for granted, such as the eight-hour workday and minimum wage laws.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency to ensure the sentence logically aligns with the historical and narrative context.", "A": "laid", "B": "lay", "C": "laying", "D": "has laid", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid correctly aligns with the historical context of the passage, describing how the strikes from a past era contributed to the establishment of labor protections.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has laid incorrectly suggests a connection to the present, which is inconsistent with the historical focus of the passage.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because lay is in the simple past form of a different verb, meaning to recline, and does not fit the intended meaning here.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle laying does not provide a complete verb for the main clause, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
