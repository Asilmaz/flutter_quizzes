{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</em> by James D. Watson (1968).", "text": "Watson recounts the race to uncover the structure of DNA, highlighting the collaboration and competition among scientists. He describes how Rosalind Franklin\u2019s X-ray diffraction images provided critical evidence. This breakthrough ______ the final pieces needed for Watson and Francis Crick to build their model of the DNA double helix, revolutionizing the study of genetics.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense and structure align with the historical narrative and logical progression of the sentence.", "A": "provides", "B": "has provided", "C": "providing", "D": "provided", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense provided reflects the historical context of the event, describing Franklin\u2019s contribution as a specific, completed action that led to the discovery of DNA\u2019s structure.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense provides suggests the action is happening currently, which contradicts the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has provided implies an ongoing connection to the present, which is unnecessary in this context.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle providing does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete."}
