{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel tells the story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught Indian mathematician whose insights transformed the field of number theory. Despite limited formal education, Ramanujan ______ groundbreaking formulas that continue to influence mathematics today, highlighting the universality of human intellect and discovery.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical alignment of the verb with the passage\u2019s historical and enduring context.", "A": "produces", "B": "producing", "C": "produced", "D": "has produced", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has produced reflects the connection between Ramanujan\u2019s past achievements and their continuing influence on modern mathematics, emphasizing their lasting significance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because produces is in the present tense, which suggests the action is happening now, disrupting the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because producing does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because produced confines the action to the past, missing its ongoing relevance to mathematics."}
