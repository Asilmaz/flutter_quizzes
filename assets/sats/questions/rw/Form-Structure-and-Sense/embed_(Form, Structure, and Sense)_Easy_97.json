{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "Carson exposes the harmful effects of widespread pesticide use, focusing on the unintended consequences for ecosystems. Her research and advocacy ______ public awareness of environmental issues, ultimately leading to changes in agricultural practices and the creation of regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the historical context of the passage.", "A": "raised", "B": "raises", "C": "has raised", "D": "raising", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense raised aligns with the historical narrative of Carson\u2019s work and its role in inspiring environmental reform during her time.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because raises suggests that the action is happening currently, which disrupts the historical context.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has raised implies an unnecessary connection to the present, which is not needed for the historical focus.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because raising does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
