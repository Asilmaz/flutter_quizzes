{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</em> by James D. Watson (1968).", "text": "Watson recounts the pivotal moments leading to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double-helix structure. While the contributions of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin were essential, their roles were often overlooked in the public eye. Franklin\u2019s meticulous work with X-ray crystallography provided the data that ______ Watson and Crick\u2019s groundbreaking model of DNA\u2019s structure.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider how possessive determiners and plural nouns are used to ensure subject-verb agreement and logical coherence within the historical context.", "A": "its", "B": "their", "C": "it\u2019s", "D": "they\u2019re", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The plural possessive determiner their correctly refers to the plural antecedent Watson and Crick, showing that the data supported their work.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the singular possessive determiner its does not agree in number with the plural antecedent Watson and Crick.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because it\u2019s is the contraction for it is or it has, which is not appropriate in this context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because they\u2019re is the contraction for they are, which does not make sense in the sentence."}
