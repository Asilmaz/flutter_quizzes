{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> by Adam Smith (1776).", "text": "Smith explored how self-interest and competition in free markets could unintentionally benefit society as a whole. He theorized that, while individuals pursue their own goals, they inadvertently contribute to the public good through what he called the invisible hand. Economists today ______ that this concept remains central to understanding market dynamics and the allocation of resources.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the chosen verb form correctly matches the subject and tense of the sentence while preserving logical coherence.", "A": "claiming", "B": "claims", "C": "claim", "D": "to claim", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The plural subject economists agrees with the plural present tense verb claim. The use of the present tense is appropriate here because the sentence describes an ongoing belief that persists among economists.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present participle claiming cannot act as the main verb in this context and fails to form a complete clause.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the singular verb claims does not agree with the plural subject economists.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the infinitive to claim does not function as the main verb and creates a grammatically incomplete sentence."}
