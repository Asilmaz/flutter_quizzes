{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking (1988).", "text": "Hawking explores the origins and nature of the universe, discussing concepts like black holes, the Big Bang, and the role of time. He explains how theoretical physics has evolved to address fundamental questions about existence. One of Hawking\u2019s key contributions ______ the understanding of how black holes emit radiation, a phenomenon now known as Hawking radiation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Focus on verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the sentence\u2019s logical alignment with the context.", "A": "advanced", "B": "was advancing", "C": "advancing", "D": "advances", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense advanced aligns with the historical nature of Hawking\u2019s contributions, describing his work as a specific and completed achievement in the field of physics.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle advancing does not provide a complete verb for the sentence, leaving it incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because was advancing suggests an ongoing action, which does not fit with the description of a specific contribution.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense advances disrupts the historical focus and incorrectly implies that Hawking is currently making the described contribution."}
