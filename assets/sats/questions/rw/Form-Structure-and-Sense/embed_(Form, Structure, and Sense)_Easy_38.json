{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wright Brothers</em> by David McCullough (2015).", "text": "McCullough chronicles the lives of Orville and Wilbur Wright and their journey to invent the first successful airplane. Despite numerous setbacks and skepticism, the brothers remained determined. Their meticulous approach to testing and refining their designs ______ the foundation for modern aviation, making powered flight a reality in 1903.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical progression of ideas within the sentence.", "A": "laid", "B": "laying", "C": "has laid", "D": "lays", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid appropriately reflects the historical context, describing the Wright brothers' significant contributions as events that occurred in the past and influenced future advancements in aviation.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the participle laying does not form a complete verb for the main clause, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has laid unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which does not align with the historical focus of the sentence.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense lays disrupts the historical narrative, suggesting the action is occurring now rather than being part of a past event."}
