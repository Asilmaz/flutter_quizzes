{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel chronicles the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician whose groundbreaking work transformed number theory. Despite limited formal education, Ramanujan developed formulas that mathematicians continue to study today. His collaboration with G.H. Hardy ______ a bridge between Eastern and Western approaches to mathematics, highlighting the universal nature of discovery.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense aligns with the historical narrative and contributes to the logical structure of the sentence.", "A": "creating", "B": "has created", "C": "created", "D": "creates", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense created reflects the historical context of Ramanujan\u2019s collaboration with Hardy as a specific event in the past.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because creating does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has created unnecessarily implies a connection to the present, which is not required in the historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because creates incorrectly suggests that the collaboration is ongoing rather than a completed event."}
