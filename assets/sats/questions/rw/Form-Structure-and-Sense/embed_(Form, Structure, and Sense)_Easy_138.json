{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "Carson\u2019s groundbreaking work exposed the environmental harm caused by pesticides, particularly their effects on bird populations and ecosystems. Her advocacy ______ the development of stricter regulations on chemical usage, leading to increased environmental protections and the eventual ban of DDT.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and environmental context of the passage.", "A": "has initiated", "B": "initiating", "C": "initiates", "D": "initiated", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense initiated reflects the historical moment when Carson\u2019s work led to significant changes in environmental policy, aligning with the passage's focus on historical events.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because initiating does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because initiates incorrectly implies the action is happening currently, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has initiated unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required in this context."}
