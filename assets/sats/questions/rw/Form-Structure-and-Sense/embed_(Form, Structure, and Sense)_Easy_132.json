{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wright Brothers</em> by David McCullough (2015).", "text": "McCullough details the Wright brothers\u2019 persistent efforts to invent the first successful powered aircraft. Their invention ______ a revolution in transportation, opening the door to modern aviation and changing the way people travel and connect across the globe.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb fits the historical context of the passage.", "A": "opens", "B": "opened", "C": "has opened", "D": "opening", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense opened reflects the historical nature of the Wright brothers\u2019 achievement, describing the invention as a completed action that brought about significant change.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because opens incorrectly implies that the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has opened unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not needed for this historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because opening does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
