{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em> by Walter Isaacson (2014).", "text": "Isaacson chronicles the history of computing, highlighting the invention of the transistor as a pivotal moment. This tiny device ______ the development of smaller, more efficient computers, fundamentally transforming industries and reshaping global communication.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and how the verb fits the historical and technological narrative of the passage.", "A": "lays", "B": "laid", "C": "has laid", "D": "laying", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid correctly reflects the historical significance of the transistor\u2019s invention as a completed action that revolutionized computing.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because lays incorrectly implies the action is happening now, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has laid unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not needed in this context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
