	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Lost Patron</em> by Elias J. Carr (2022).",
	"text": "Lady Bronwellâ€™s estate has long been famous for its vibrant gardens, but a recent drought has left them struggling to survive. Only her steadfast gardener, who ______ tirelessly each morning, has prevented the complete demise of the plants.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to pronoun-antecedent agreement and verb form consistency.",
	"A": "were watering the flowers",
	"B": "waters the flowers",
	"C": "water the flowers",
	"D": "was watering the flowers",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>B</strong> is correct because the singular subject gardener takes the singular present tense verb waters, which also matches the ongoing nature of the activity. <strong>A</strong> were watering incorrectly uses a plural verb. <strong>C</strong> water is a plural verb form. <strong>D</strong> was watering implies a past progressive action rather than a continuous present action."
