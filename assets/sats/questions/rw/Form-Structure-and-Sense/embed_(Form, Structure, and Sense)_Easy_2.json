{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking (1988).", "text": "According to the general theory of relativity, the force of gravity arises from the curvature of space-time caused by mass. This curvature tells objects how to move and dictates the paths that light and matter follow. The bending of light around massive objects, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, ______ considered one of the strongest confirmations of Einstein\u2019s theory.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Analyze the subject-verb agreement and ensure the tense aligns with the enduring relevance of the scientific principle described.", "A": "are", "B": "have been", "C": "is", "D": "were", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The singular subject bending of light agrees with the singular verb is, and the present tense appropriately reflects the ongoing acceptance of gravitational lensing as a confirmation of Einstein's theory.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the plural verb are does not agree with the singular subject bending of light.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect tense have been is inconsistent with the present tense focus of the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the past tense were inaccurately implies that gravitational lensing is no longer considered relevant or valid as a confirmation."}
