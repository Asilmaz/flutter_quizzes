{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em> by Walter Isaacson (2014).", "text": "Isaacson examines the history of computing and the individuals who contributed to its development. The invention of the microprocessor in the 1970s ______ the creation of smaller, faster, and more efficient computers, fundamentally transforming industries and personal technology.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the historical and technological context of the passage.", "A": "allows", "B": "allowed", "C": "has allowed", "D": "allowing", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed reflects the historical context of the invention of the microprocessor and its role in enabling subsequent technological advancements.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allows implies the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for this context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
