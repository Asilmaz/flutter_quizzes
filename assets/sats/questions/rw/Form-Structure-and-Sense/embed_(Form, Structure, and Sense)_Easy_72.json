{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</em> by Jared Diamond (1997).", "text": "Diamond explores the factors that shaped human societies, focusing on the development of agriculture and the domestication of plants and animals. He argues that access to suitable crops and livestock ______ certain societies to develop advanced technology and political systems earlier than others, influencing global patterns of power and wealth.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical relationship between the ideas presented in the sentence.", "A": "allowed", "B": "allowing", "C": "allows", "D": "has allowed", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed aligns with the historical focus of the passage, describing how access to certain resources influenced societal development at specific points in history.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies that the process is happening currently, rather than being a historical phenomenon.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has allowed suggests ongoing relevance that is unnecessary for the sentence\u2019s focus on historical events."}
