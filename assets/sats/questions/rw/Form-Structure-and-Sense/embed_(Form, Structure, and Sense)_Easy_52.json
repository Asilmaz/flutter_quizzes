{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2016).", "text": "Mukherjee explores the history of genetic science, from Mendel\u2019s pea plant experiments to the discovery of DNA\u2019s structure. He highlights the profound impact of genetic research on medicine and society, noting that breakthroughs in understanding genetic mutations ______ the way for targeted therapies that address previously untreatable diseases.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the sentence\u2019s alignment with the historical and scientific context.", "A": "paving", "B": "paved", "C": "pave", "D": "has paved", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has paved reflects the connection between past breakthroughs in genetic research and their ongoing influence on modern medicine.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle paving does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the past tense paved confines the action to the past, failing to capture its lasting significance.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense pave suggests the action is occurring now, which does not align with the broader narrative."}
