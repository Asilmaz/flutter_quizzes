{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> by Rebecca Skloot (2010).", "text": "Henrietta Lacks was a young African American woman whose cells, taken without her knowledge in 1951, became one of the most important tools in medicine. Known as HeLa cells, they were the first human cells to grow successfully in a laboratory. These cells ______ countless breakthroughs, including the development of the polio vaccine, cancer treatments, and in-vitro fertilization techniques.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency while selecting the most logical and grammatically correct option.", "A": "were enabling", "B": "enable", "C": "enabled", "D": "has enabled", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense enabled is consistent with the historical narrative of the text, as the sentence discusses the role HeLa cells played in past medical breakthroughs.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense enable is inconsistent with the past tense context of the passage.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the past progressive were enabling implies ongoing action at a specific point in the past, which does not align with the broader historical context being described.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has enabled unnecessarily ties the breakthroughs to the present when the focus is on historical achievements."}
