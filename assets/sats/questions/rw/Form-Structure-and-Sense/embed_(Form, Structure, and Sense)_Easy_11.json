	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Medieval Innovations</em> by Josephine Clarke (2018).",
	"text": "During the twelfth century, engineers designed massive waterwheels along the river. Their rotating paddles harnessed the current to grind grain, an innovation that ______ local agriculture to flourish.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense and the cause-and-effect implied in the sentence.",
	"A": "enables",
	"B": "enabled",
	"C": "are enabling",
	"D": "will enable",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>B</strong> is correct because we are describing a historical innovation that allowed local agriculture to thrive, so the past tense enabled is appropriate. <strong>A</strong> enables places the action in the present, which is inaccurate historically. <strong>C</strong> are enabling uses the plural subject incorrectly (the innovation is singular) and is present tense. <strong>D</strong> will enable suggests a future effect, which doesnâ€™t match the historical context."
