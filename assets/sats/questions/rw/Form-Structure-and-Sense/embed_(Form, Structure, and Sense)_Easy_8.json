{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson (2003).", "text": "For centuries, scientists debated the nature of Earth\u2019s core, which lies thousands of kilometers beneath the surface. It was not until seismic waves were studied in the 20th century that the core\u2019s composition ______ understood. This discovery revealed the existence of a solid inner core surrounded by a molten outer layer, fundamentally changing our understanding of the planet.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Focus on subject-verb agreement and the appropriate tense to reflect the historical context of the discovery.", "A": "was", "B": "had been", "C": "is", "D": "being", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense was correctly reflects the historical context, indicating that the understanding of Earth\u2019s core occurred as a specific event in the past.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense is disrupts the historical context and suggests the discovery is ongoing rather than completed in the past.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the past perfect had been unnecessarily implies a prior action relative to another past event, which is not established in this sentence.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present participle being fails to provide a complete verb for the main clause, resulting in a grammatically incomplete sentence."}
