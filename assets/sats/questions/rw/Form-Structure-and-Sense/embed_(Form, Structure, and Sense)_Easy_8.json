	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Art of Observation</em> by Charlotte DuPont (2019).",
	"text": "In her field notes, the anthropologist recorded subtle gestures and social cues. These observations, which ______ crucial to understanding the tribeâ€™s communication patterns, underscore the importance of immersive study.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the pronoun-antecedent agreement and correct verb form.",
	"A": "was",
	"B": "is",
	"C": "were",
	"D": "being",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>C</strong> is correct because the plural subject These observations requires the plural past tense verb were. <strong>A</strong> was is singular. <strong>B</strong> is is singular present tense, which conflicts with the more historical context. <strong>D</strong> being creates a fragment and does not function as a main verb."
