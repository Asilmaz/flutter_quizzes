{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Right Stuff</em> by Tom Wolfe (1979).", "text": "Wolfe chronicles the early days of space exploration, focusing on the Mercury Seven astronauts and their extraordinary bravery. Their missions, despite the dangers, ______ the foundation for human spaceflight, proving that humans could survive and operate in the harsh conditions of space.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense aligns with the historical and scientific context, and pay attention to the logical progression of the narrative.", "A": "lays", "B": "has laid", "C": "laying", "D": "laid", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid aligns with the historical context, describing the Mercury Seven\u2019s achievements as completed events that established the foundation for human space exploration.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because lays is in the present tense, which disrupts the historical focus and suggests the action is happening now.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has laid implies a connection to the present that is unnecessary for this historical narrative."}
