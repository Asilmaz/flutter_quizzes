{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wright Brothers</em> by David McCullough (2015).", "text": "McCullough discusses the Wright brothers\u2019 relentless pursuit of powered flight, focusing on their numerous trials and their eventual success. Their achievement ______ the development of modern aviation, changing transportation and reshaping global connectivity forever.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the alignment of the verb with the historical and technological context of the passage.", "A": "laid", "B": "laying", "C": "has laid", "D": "lays", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid correctly reflects the historical nature of the Wright brothers' achievement, describing their invention as a completed action that established the foundation for modern aviation.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has laid implies a connection to the present, which is not required for the historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because lays implies the action is ongoing, which disrupts the historical focus."}
