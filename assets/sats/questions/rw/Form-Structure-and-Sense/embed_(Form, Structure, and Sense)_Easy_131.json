{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> by Rebecca Skloot (2010).", "text": "Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells were taken without her knowledge and became one of the most important tools in modern medicine. HeLa cells ______ groundbreaking contributions to cancer research, vaccine development, and other areas of biotechnology, transforming the field of biomedical science.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific context.", "A": "makes", "B": "made", "C": "making", "D": "has made", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has made connects the historical contribution of HeLa cells to their ongoing impact on science, highlighting their lasting influence.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because made confines the action to the past, which does not emphasize the continued relevance of HeLa cells.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because making does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because makes incorrectly implies that the action is happening currently, which is inconsistent with the historical focus."}
