{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Cosmos</em> by Carl Sagan (1980).", "text": "Sagan describes the evolution of scientific understanding, from early astronomy to modern cosmology. He highlights how the invention of the telescope ______ astronomers to observe distant galaxies and stars, vastly expanding our understanding of the universe\u2019s scale and complexity.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative of the passage.", "A": "allowing", "B": "has allowed", "C": "allowed", "D": "allows", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed reflects the historical context of the telescope\u2019s invention and its impact on expanding the horizons of astronomical observation.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies the action is happening currently, disrupting the historical narrative."}
