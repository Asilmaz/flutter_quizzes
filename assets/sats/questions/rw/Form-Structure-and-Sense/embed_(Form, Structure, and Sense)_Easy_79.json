{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "Carson exposed the environmental and health dangers of pesticides such as DDT, arguing that these chemicals accumulated in ecosystems and disrupted the natural balance. Her work ______ awareness about the consequences of chemical use in agriculture, eventually leading to policy changes and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense is consistent with the historical narrative and aligns with the broader environmental context described.", "A": "raising", "B": "has raised", "C": "raises", "D": "raised", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has raised connects Carson\u2019s historical work with its lasting influence on environmental policy, emphasizing its continuing relevance today.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because raising does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because raised limits the action to the past, missing the ongoing significance of Carson\u2019s work.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because raises implies the action is happening now, which does not align with the historical focus of the sentence."}
