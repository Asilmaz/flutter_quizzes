{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Right Stuff</em> by Tom Wolfe (1979).", "text": "Wolfe explores the lives of America\u2019s first astronauts, highlighting their bravery and the challenges they faced during the early days of space exploration. The Mercury Seven, chosen for their exceptional skills and resilience, ______ the way for subsequent space missions by proving that humans could endure the extreme conditions of space travel.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the sentence\u2019s alignment with the historical narrative.", "A": "have paved", "B": "paved", "C": "pave", "D": "paving", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect have paved connects the Mercury Seven\u2019s accomplishments in the past to their ongoing impact on modern space exploration, emphasizing their enduring significance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because pave is in the present tense, which does not align with the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because paved confines the action to the past, missing its connection to the ongoing legacy of the Mercury Seven.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because paving does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete."}
