{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</em> by Dava Sobel (1995).", "text": "John Harrison, an 18th-century clockmaker, solved the longstanding problem of determining longitude at sea with the invention of the marine chronometer. This achievement ______ safer and more accurate navigation, reducing maritime disasters and advancing global trade during the Age of Exploration.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay careful attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical relationship between the sentence and its historical context.", "A": "enabling", "B": "has enabled", "C": "enabled", "D": "enable", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense enabled appropriately reflects the historical context of Harrison\u2019s invention, describing its significant impact during a specific period in history.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because enabling does not form a complete verb for the sentence, making it grammatically incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has enabled unnecessarily ties the historical event to the present, which is not required for this context.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because enable is in the present tense, disrupting the historical narrative and suggesting the action is occurring now."}
