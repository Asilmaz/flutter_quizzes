{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Endurance: Shackleton\u2019s Incredible Voyage</em> by Alfred Lansing (1959).", "text": "In 1915, Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew faced unimaginable challenges when their ship, the Endurance, became trapped in Antarctic ice. Determined to save his men, Shackleton led an extraordinary journey across ice floes and stormy seas. As they prepared for the voyage, the crew ______ their supplies, fortifying themselves for the harsh conditions they would face in their bid for survival.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement and tense consistency, ensuring the sentence aligns with the historical narrative provided.", "A": "gather", "B": "have gathered", "C": "gathered", "D": "were gathering", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense gathered aligns with the historical context and fits the narrative describing actions that occurred as part of the 1915 expedition.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense gather disrupts the past narrative, implying the action is happening currently.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect have gathered suggests an action with ongoing relevance, which does not align with the past-focused historical account.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the past progressive were gathering implies an action still in progress at the described moment, whereas the context calls for a completed action."}
