{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</em> by Doris Kearns Goodwin (2005).", "text": "Goodwin examines how Abraham Lincoln united his cabinet members, who often held opposing views, to effectively lead the country during the Civil War. His ability to foster collaboration and resolve conflicts ______ the Union through one of the most challenging periods in American history.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the alignment of the verb with the historical and political context of the passage.", "A": "ensures", "B": "ensuring", "C": "ensured", "D": "has ensured", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense ensured correctly reflects Lincoln\u2019s leadership as a historical action that led to the preservation of the Union during the Civil War.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because ensuring does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because ensures incorrectly implies the action is occurring currently, disrupting the historical narrative.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has ensured unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not required in this context."}
