{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> by Richard Rhodes (1986).", "text": "Rhodes recounts the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, focusing on the collaboration between scientists from around the world. The Manhattan Project brought together brilliant minds, including physicists like J. Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi. Their groundbreaking work ______ an unprecedented level of scientific achievement but also raised profound ethical questions about the use of such technology.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the broader historical and ethical implications discussed in the passage.", "A": "represents", "B": "represented", "C": "has represented", "D": "representing", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense represented aligns with the historical focus of the Manhattan Project and appropriately describes its significance as a completed event.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because represents incorrectly implies that the event is occurring in the present, disrupting the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has represented unnecessarily connects the event to the present, which is not required for the context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because representing does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence grammatically incomplete."}
