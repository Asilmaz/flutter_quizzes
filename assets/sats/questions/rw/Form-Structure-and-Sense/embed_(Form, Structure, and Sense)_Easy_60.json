{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> by Rebecca Skloot (2010).", "text": "Henrietta Lacks\u2019s cells, known as HeLa cells, became one of the most important tools in modern medicine. Taken without her knowledge in 1951, these cells were the first to reproduce indefinitely in a lab. They ______ medical research, leading to the development of the polio vaccine, cancer treatments, and advances in genetic research.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the broader scientific context of the sentence.", "A": "transform", "B": "has transformed", "C": "transformed", "D": "transforming", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense transformed aligns with the historical context of HeLa cells\u2019 contributions, describing their significant impact as part of completed advancements in medicine.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense transform suggests that the action is ongoing, which does not align with the historical narrative.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has transformed implies a connection to the present that is unnecessary given the historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because transforming does not form a complete verb for the sentence, leaving it grammatically incomplete."}
