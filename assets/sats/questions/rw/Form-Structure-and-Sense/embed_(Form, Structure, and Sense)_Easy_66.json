{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "Carson\u2019s landmark work exposed the widespread dangers of pesticides such as DDT, which were extensively used in agriculture during the mid-20th century. She argued that these chemicals ______ ecosystems by killing wildlife, contaminating water supplies, and threatening human health, sparking a movement that ultimately led to stricter environmental regulations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the broader historical narrative.", "A": "disrupt", "B": "disrupted", "C": "has disrupted", "D": "disrupting", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense disrupted aligns with the historical context of Carson\u2019s observations and the environmental effects of pesticide use during that time period.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because disrupt incorrectly implies the action is occurring in the present rather than being tied to a historical period.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has disrupted ties the action unnecessarily to the present, which is not required in this historical narrative.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because disrupting does not form a complete verb for the sentence, making it grammatically incomplete."}
