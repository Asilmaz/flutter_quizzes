{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Right Stuff</em> by Tom Wolfe (1979).", "text": "Wolfe describes the rigorous training and dangerous missions undertaken by America\u2019s first astronauts during the space race. He highlights the courage and determination of the Mercury Seven, who faced significant risks to push the boundaries of space exploration. Their achievements ______ public fascination with the possibilities of space travel and inspired a generation to dream of reaching the stars.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical flow of the sentence within the historical context.", "A": "ignited", "B": "ignites", "C": "igniting", "D": "has ignited", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense ignited aligns with the historical context of the Mercury Seven\u2019s contributions, describing their impact on public interest during the early days of space exploration.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has ignited implies a connection to the present that does not align with the historical focus of the sentence.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense ignites suggests the action is occurring now, which conflicts with the historical narrative.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle igniting does not provide a complete verb for the main clause, resulting in an incomplete sentence."}
