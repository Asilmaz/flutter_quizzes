{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel explores the life and work of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to number theory. Despite limited formal training, Ramanujan\u2019s insights ______ mathematicians worldwide, inspiring new theories and pushing the boundaries of mathematical research.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb fits the historical context.", "A": "inspire", "B": "inspired", "C": "has inspired", "D": "inspiring", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has inspired connects Ramanujan\u2019s historical contributions to their ongoing impact on modern mathematics, emphasizing their lasting influence.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because inspire implies the action is happening now, disrupting the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because inspired confines the action to the past, missing the connection to its ongoing significance.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because inspiring does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
