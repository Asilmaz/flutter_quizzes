{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</em> by Dava Sobel (1995).", "text": "In the 18th century, determining a ship\u2019s exact location at sea was one of the most pressing scientific challenges. John Harrison, a self-educated clockmaker, designed a series of revolutionary timepieces that allowed sailors to measure longitude with unprecedented accuracy. Harrison ______ his knowledge of mechanics and craftsmanship to build what became known as the marine chronometer, forever changing navigation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay careful attention to the consistency of verb tense and subject-verb agreement, ensuring that the sentence logically aligns with the historical context.", "A": "applied", "B": "applies", "C": "applying", "D": "was applying", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense applied aligns with the historical context of the passage, which describes Harrison\u2019s actions during the 18th century.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present participle applying does not form a complete verb for the main clause, resulting in a grammatically incomplete sentence.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense applies disrupts the historical narrative, implying that Harrison\u2019s actions are occurring in the present.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the past progressive was applying suggests an ongoing action without specifying a completed event, which does not fit the context of a definitive achievement."}
