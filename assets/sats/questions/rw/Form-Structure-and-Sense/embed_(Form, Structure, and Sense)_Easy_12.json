	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Political Oratory</em> by Marian K. Diaz (2021).",
	"text": "In her speech, the senator presented a compelling argument against policy reform. As a result, many constituents, who ______ originally supported the reform, changed their positions.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider the tense needed to reflect a shift in stance over time.",
	"A": "will have",
	"B": "had",
	"C": "have",
	"D": "are having",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>B</strong> is correct because had originally supported indicates a past condition that changed after the senatorâ€™s speech. <strong>A</strong> will have suggests future perfect tense, which is not logical here. <strong>C</strong> have places the action in the present. <strong>D</strong> are having is ungrammatical in this context."
