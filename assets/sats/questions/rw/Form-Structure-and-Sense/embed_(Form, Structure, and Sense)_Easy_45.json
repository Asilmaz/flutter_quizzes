{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption</em> by Laura Hillenbrand (2010).", "text": "Hillenbrand recounts the incredible journey of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete turned World War II bombardier. After his plane crashed in the Pacific, Zamperini survived on a life raft for weeks, enduring starvation and shark attacks. Later, he was captured and endured brutal treatment in a Japanese POW camp. His resilience ______ an inspiring testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable adversity.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense aligns with the historical narrative and the ongoing relevance of the subject\u2019s impact.", "A": "symbolizes", "B": "symbolizing", "C": "has symbolized", "D": "symbolized", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present tense symbolizes reflects the enduring relevance of Zamperini\u2019s resilience, emphasizing that his story continues to inspire readers and highlight the strength of the human spirit.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle symbolizing does not provide a complete verb for the sentence, leaving it incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has symbolized implies a past event with continued relevance, but the focus here is on the enduring symbolic meaning, making the simple present more appropriate.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the past tense symbolized limits the action to the past, failing to capture the ongoing impact of Zamperini\u2019s story."}
