{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America</em> by Erik Larson (2003).", "text": "Larson details the extraordinary events surrounding the 1893 World\u2019s Fair in Chicago, where architects and engineers worked to create an unprecedented spectacle of innovation. Amid the triumphs of the fair, Larson explores the darker story of H.H. Holmes, a con artist and serial killer. The fair\u2019s success ______ a testament to human ingenuity, while its darker aspects highlight the complex interplay between progress and morality.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Evaluate subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the sentence\u2019s logical progression in its historical context.", "A": "serving as", "B": "served as", "C": "serves as", "D": "has served as", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense served as aligns with the historical narrative of the 1893 World\u2019s Fair, describing its impact as a completed event with enduring significance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle serving as does not provide a complete verb, making the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the simple present serves as incorrectly implies that the fair is ongoing, rather than a past event with historical significance.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has served as unnecessarily connects the event to the present, which does not align with the passage\u2019s focus on history."}
