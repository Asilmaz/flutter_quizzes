{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration</em> by Isabel Wilkerson (2010).", "text": "Wilkerson chronicles the migration of African Americans from the rural South to urban centers in the North and West during the 20th century. She explores the challenges they faced and the opportunities they sought in building new lives. This movement ______ the social and economic landscapes of the United States, leaving an enduring legacy of resilience and change.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense and structure align with the subject and the narrative context of the passage.", "A": "transforms", "B": "transformed", "C": "transforming", "D": "has transformed", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has transformed connects the historical event to its continuing impact, emphasizing the migration's lasting effects on American society.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense transforms implies the action is occurring now, which does not reflect the historical focus of the passage.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the past tense transformed confines the event to the past, neglecting its ongoing significance.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the participle transforming does not provide a complete verb for the sentence, making it incomplete."}
