{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson (2003).", "text": "Bryson explores scientific discoveries that have shaped our understanding of the world, often highlighting the persistence and curiosity of scientists. He describes how geologists worked to determine the age of the Earth, eventually concluding that it is approximately 4.5 billion years old. This determination ______ debates about the timeline of Earth\u2019s formation, allowing scientists to focus on understanding its evolution.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical relationship between the clause and its context.", "A": "resolved", "B": "has resolved", "C": "resolves", "D": "resolving", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has resolved reflects the ongoing relevance of the discovery while acknowledging that the resolution occurred in the past and continues to have implications for scientific understanding today.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the past tense resolved restricts the action to the past, missing the nuance of its continuing importance.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the simple present resolves does not align with the historical and ongoing implications of the event.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because resolving does not form a complete verb for the sentence, making it incomplete."}
