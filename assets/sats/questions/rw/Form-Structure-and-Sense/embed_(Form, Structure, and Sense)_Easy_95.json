{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</em> by Dava Sobel (1995).", "text": "Sobel details John Harrison\u2019s invention of the marine chronometer, a device that solved the problem of determining longitude at sea. This achievement ______ maritime navigation by making ocean travel safer and more precise, reducing shipwrecks and opening new opportunities for global exploration.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the historical context of the passage.", "A": "transforms", "B": "has transformed", "C": "transformed", "D": "transforming", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense transformed reflects the historical nature of Harrison\u2019s invention and its significant impact on navigation during his time.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because transforms incorrectly implies the action is occurring now, disrupting the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has transformed implies a connection to the present that is unnecessary for the context of the historical impact.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because transforming does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete."}
