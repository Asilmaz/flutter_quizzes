{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> by Rebecca Skloot (2010).", "text": "Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells, taken without her knowledge in 1951, became the first immortal human cell line. Known as HeLa cells, they have been used in countless medical breakthroughs, including the development of vaccines and cancer treatments. Despite their immense contributions to science, the origins of HeLa cells ______ largely unknown to the public until decades later.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense and structure align with the historical and contextual narrative of the sentence.", "A": "have remained", "B": "remained", "C": "remaining", "D": "remains", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect have remained reflects the continuing relevance of the lack of public awareness about HeLa cells, connecting the past event to the present.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle remaining does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the past tense remained restricts the action to the past, ignoring the continued lack of awareness highlighted by the narrative.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense remains implies the action is solely occurring now, without acknowledging its connection to the past."}
