{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</em> by Dava Sobel (1995).", "text": "Sobel recounts John Harrison\u2019s invention of the marine chronometer, a device that revolutionized maritime navigation. Before its development, sailors relied on inaccurate methods to determine longitude at sea, often resulting in shipwrecks. Harrison\u2019s chronometer ______ a new era of safer and more reliable global exploration.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the alignment of the verb with the historical context presented in the sentence.", "A": "opens", "B": "has opened", "C": "opened", "D": "opening", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense opened accurately reflects the historical impact of Harrison\u2019s invention during the time of its creation and usage.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because opens incorrectly implies that the action is occurring currently, disrupting the historical narrative.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has opened unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical focus of the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because opening does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
