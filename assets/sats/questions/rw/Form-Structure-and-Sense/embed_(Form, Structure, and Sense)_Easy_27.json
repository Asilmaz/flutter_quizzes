{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</em> by Doris Kearns Goodwin (2005).", "text": "Goodwin details how Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with political opponents to form a cabinet that encouraged diverse perspectives. This strategy, while initially controversial, proved crucial during the Civil War. By including individuals with differing viewpoints, Lincoln ______ an environment where debate could lead to stronger decisions and unity in a time of crisis.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Evaluate the sentence for subject-verb agreement and tense consistency, ensuring the correct answer aligns with the historical narrative.", "A": "foster", "B": "fostered", "C": "fostering", "D": "fosters", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense fostered correctly reflects the historical context and aligns with the description of Lincoln's actions during the Civil War.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the plural verb foster does not agree with the singular subject Lincoln.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense fosters disrupts the past narrative, incorrectly implying the action is occurring now.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle fostering does not form a grammatically complete main clause."}
