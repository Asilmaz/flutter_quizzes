	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Reflections on Global Exploration</em> by Dr. Lucia Holt (2021).",
	"text": "Sailing through turbulent waters, the research team spent months gathering data on ocean currents. This effort, which ______ significant changes in migratory patterns, led them to propose new guidelines for marine conservation.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Focus on verb tense consistency and subject-verb agreement in selecting the best option.",
	"A": "has revealed",
	"B": "reveal",
	"C": "was revealing",
	"D": "reveals",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>A</strong> is correct. The subject this effort is singular, and a present perfect tense (has revealed) suits the ongoing relevance of the discovery. <strong>B</strong> reveal is plural and does not agree with the singular subject. <strong>C</strong> was revealing uses a past continuous tense that conflicts with the completed nature of the research. <strong>D</strong> reveals is present tense but does not convey that the discovery began in the past and continues to hold significance."
