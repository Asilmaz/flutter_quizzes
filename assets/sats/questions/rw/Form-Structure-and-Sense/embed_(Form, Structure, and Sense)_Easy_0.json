{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>On the Origin of Species</em> by Charles Darwin (1859).", "text": "In the struggle for existence, individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to future generations. This process, which Darwin called \u201cnatural selection,\u201d ______ the theory that life evolves over time through incremental changes. By examining variations in species, Darwin proposed that favorable traits accumulate within populations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement and proper tense use when choosing the correct answer. The selected word must fit seamlessly into the context while maintaining logical consistency.", "A": "demonstrates", "B": "demonstrated", "C": "demonstrate", "D": "will demonstrate", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The singular subject process agrees in number with the singular present tense verb demonstrates. The present tense is also appropriate for discussing established scientific principles and theories, which are often expressed in the present tense to indicate their ongoing validity.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the plural verb demonstrate does not agree in number with the singular subject process.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the past tense demonstrated implies that the theory is no longer valid, which is not consistent with the timeless nature of Darwin's explanation.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the future tense will demonstrate implies that the process is yet to show its validity, which conflicts with the historical and ongoing relevance of natural selection as described by Darwin."}
