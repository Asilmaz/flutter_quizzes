{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wright Brothers</em> by David McCullough (2015).", "text": "In December 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright made history by achieving the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft. This groundbreaking event took place on the windy dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The brothers\u2019 invention, as well as their methodical approach to solving engineering challenges, ______ foundational for modern aviation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Focus on subject-verb agreement and selecting the appropriate verb tense to reflect the historical significance and context.", "A": "were", "B": "being", "C": "have been", "D": "was", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The singular subject The brothers\u2019 invention, as well as their methodical approach agrees with the singular verb was. The past tense is appropriate because the sentence describes a historical event.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the plural verb were does not agree with the singular subject The brothers\u2019 invention, as well as their methodical approach.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect have been implies a connection to the present, which is inconsistent with the sentence\u2019s focus on the historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present participle being does not form a complete verb for the main clause, resulting in an incomplete sentence."}
