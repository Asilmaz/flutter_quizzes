{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel recounts the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian mathematician who made extraordinary contributions to number theory. Despite having little formal training, Ramanujan developed formulas and theorems that continue to influence modern mathematics. His collaboration with the British mathematician G.H. Hardy ______ the mathematical world, bridging gaps between Eastern and Western approaches to the field.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense aligns with the historical narrative, and consider how subject-verb agreement affects the sentence structure.", "A": "transforming", "B": "transformed", "C": "has transformed", "D": "transforms", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has transformed appropriately reflects the ongoing influence of Ramanujan and Hardy\u2019s collaboration on mathematics, connecting the historical event to its continuing relevance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because transforming is a participle that does not form a complete verb, making the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the past tense transformed restricts the action to the past, ignoring the ongoing significance of their work.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the simple present transforms incorrectly implies that the collaboration is occurring now rather than having already taken place."}
