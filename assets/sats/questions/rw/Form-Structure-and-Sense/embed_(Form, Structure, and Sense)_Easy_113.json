{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking (1988).", "text": "Hawking delves into the origins of the universe, focusing on concepts such as black holes and time\u2019s curvature. He explains how the theory of general relativity ______ the way scientists understand gravitational forces, opening new pathways for the study of the cosmos.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative of the passage.", "A": "transforming", "B": "transformed", "C": "has transformed", "D": "transforms", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense transformed correctly reflects the historical impact of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity on the scientific understanding of gravity during the 20th century.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because transforming does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because transforms implies the action is occurring now, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has transformed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for this context."}
