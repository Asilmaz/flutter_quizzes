Before its development, sailors struggled to accurately calculate longitude at sea, resulting in frequent shipwrecks. Harrison\u2019s invention ______ a new era of safer and more precise maritime exploration.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative of the passage.", "A": "opened", "B": "opening", "C": "opens", "D": "has opened", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has opened emphasizes the continuing influence of Harrison\u2019s invention on modern navigation, connecting its historical significance to its ongoing impact.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because opened confines the action to the past, failing to emphasize its continued relevance.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because opens incorrectly implies the action is happening currently, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because opening does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
