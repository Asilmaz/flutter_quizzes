{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2010).", "text": "Mukherjee traces the history of cancer research, from early treatments to the modern era of targeted therapies. He highlights how advances in technology and molecular biology have revolutionized the understanding of this disease. One breakthrough involved the identification of oncogenes, genes that, when mutated, ______ uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation, offering scientists crucial insights into cancer\u2019s mechanisms.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Evaluate subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical flow of the sentence in its broader scientific context.", "A": "has triggered", "B": "trigger", "C": "triggers", "D": "triggering", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The plural verb trigger agrees with the plural subject genes and fits within the present tense narrative, as the sentence discusses a general scientific concept.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has triggered suggests a singular subject and implies a past action with relevance to the present, which does not align with the plural subject and the ongoing relevance of the concept.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the participle triggering does not form a complete verb for the main clause, resulting in an incomplete sentence.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the singular verb triggers does not agree with the plural subject genes."}
