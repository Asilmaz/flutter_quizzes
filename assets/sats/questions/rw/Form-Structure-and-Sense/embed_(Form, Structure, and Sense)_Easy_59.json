{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</em> by Edmund Morris (1979).", "text": "Morris traces Roosevelt\u2019s journey from a sickly child to a dynamic leader, highlighting his unyielding determination and love of adventure. As a young man, Roosevelt threw himself into public service, earning a reputation for integrity and bold action. His efforts as a reformer ______ the foundation for his later presidency, during which he championed progressive causes and conservation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical structure of the sentence.", "A": "laid", "B": "laying", "C": "has laid", "D": "lays", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid aligns with the historical context of Roosevelt\u2019s early career, describing his efforts as completed actions that influenced his later presidency.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has laid implies a connection to the present, which is unnecessary given the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because laying does not provide a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense lays disrupts the historical context, suggesting the action is occurring now."}
