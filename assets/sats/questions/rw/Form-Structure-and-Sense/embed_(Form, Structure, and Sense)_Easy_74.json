{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Soul of a New Machine</em> by Tracy Kidder (1981).", "text": "Kidder recounts the efforts of a team of engineers working on the development of a groundbreaking minicomputer. Despite long hours and technical setbacks, the team\u2019s dedication and innovative approach ______ a new standard for computing, influencing the design and functionality of modern technology.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical alignment of the verb with the historical and ongoing impact described in the passage.", "A": "set", "B": "setting", "C": "has set", "D": "sets", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has set effectively bridges the historical achievements of the engineering team with their lasting influence on modern computing, emphasizing the ongoing significance of their work.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the past tense set confines the action to the past, missing its connection to the lasting impact described in the passage.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because setting does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence grammatically incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because sets is in the present tense, which incorrectly implies the action is occurring now, disrupting the historical context."}
