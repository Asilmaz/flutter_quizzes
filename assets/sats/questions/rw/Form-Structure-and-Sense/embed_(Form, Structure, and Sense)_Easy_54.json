{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em> by Walter Isaacson (2014).", "text": "Isaacson recounts the development of computer technology, focusing on the contributions of individuals and teams who advanced the digital age. He describes how the invention of the microchip ______ the foundation for modern computing, enabling the creation of personal computers and the internet, which revolutionized global communication.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the logical flow of ideas within the historical narrative.", "A": "lays", "B": "laid", "C": "laying", "D": "has laid", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid appropriately reflects the historical context, describing the microchip\u2019s introduction as a completed event that significantly shaped the development of modern computing.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense lays disrupts the historical focus and incorrectly suggests the event is occurring now.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has laid suggests a continuing action or relevance, which is unnecessary in this context.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle laying does not provide a complete verb for the sentence, leaving it incomplete."}
