	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Astronomy Through the Ages</em> by Karim Fontes (2021).",
	"text": "Centuries ago, astronomers relied on hand-drawn star charts. By cataloguing thousands of celestial objects, they laid the groundwork for future discoveries, which ______ incomplete without these meticulous observations.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider how the relative pronoun which refers back to future discoveries.",
	"A": "would have been",
	"B": "have been",
	"C": "had being",
	"D": "was",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>A</strong> is correct because it properly indicates a hypothetical condition in the past (would have been incomplete). <strong>B</strong> have been changes the meaning and tense incorrectly. <strong>C</strong> had being is ungrammatical. <strong>D</strong> was incomplete does not capture the conditional nature of those future discoveries."
