{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs</em> by Steve Brusatte (2018).", "text": "In the late Jurassic period, dinosaurs flourished in ecosystems rich with vegetation and diverse prey. One of the most notable species of the time, the Diplodocus, was a massive herbivore that roamed what is now North America. Fossil evidence suggests that by the end of the Jurassic, populations of Diplodocus ______ significantly, likely due to changes in climate and food availability.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Focus on selecting a verb form that appropriately conveys the time frame of the described events and maintains logical coherence with the historical context.", "A": "has declined", "B": "had declined", "C": "decline", "D": "will decline", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past perfect had declined is appropriate because it indicates that the decline occurred before the end of the Jurassic period, establishing a clear sequence of events.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has declined suggests a connection to the present, which is inconsistent with the historical context of the passage.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present tense decline disrupts the past narrative and incorrectly implies an ongoing process.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the future tense will decline inaccurately suggests that the decline had not yet occurred by the end of the Jurassic period."}
