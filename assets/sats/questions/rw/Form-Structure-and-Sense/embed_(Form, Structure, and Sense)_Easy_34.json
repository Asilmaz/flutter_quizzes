{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race</em> by Margot Lee Shetterly (2016).", "text": "Shetterly recounts the remarkable contributions of African American women mathematicians at NASA during the mid-20th century. These women, often referred to as human computers, played a critical role in calculating the trajectories for groundbreaking space missions. Their expertise and determination ______ stereotypes about women\u2019s roles in science and technology, paving the way for future generations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency in the context of the passage.", "A": "challenges", "B": "has challenged", "C": "challenging", "D": "challenged", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense challenged aligns with the historical narrative of the text, describing the impact these mathematicians had during a specific period in history.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense challenges implies the action is occurring now, which conflicts with the historical context of the passage.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle challenging does not form a complete verb for the sentence, leaving it incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has challenged implies a connection to the present, which is unnecessary for the described historical events."}
