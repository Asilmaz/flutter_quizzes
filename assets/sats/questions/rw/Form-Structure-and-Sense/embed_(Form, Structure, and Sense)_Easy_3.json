	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Origins of Democracy</em> by Helena Foster (2019).",
	"text": "Historians studying ancient city-states have unearthed evidence of inclusive councils where even common laborers voiced opinions. These findings suggest that the practice of public discourse, which ______ in many modern governments, may have roots far older than previously assumed.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Remember to match the relative pronounâ€™s antecedent with correct verb agreement.",
	"A": "prevail",
	"B": "prevails",
	"C": "prevailing",
	"D": "has been prevail",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>B</strong> is correct because the antecedent the practice is singular, so it takes the singular verb prevails. <strong>A</strong> prevail is plural. <strong>C</strong> prevailing is not a conjugated verb form here, and <strong>D</strong> has been prevail is ungrammatical."
