{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "The insecticide DDT was once heralded as a miracle of modern science for its ability to eradicate pests threatening agriculture and human health. However, as Carson detailed, DDT accumulated in the environment and disrupted ecosystems. Its toxic effects rippled through food chains, with evidence showing that it ______ in birds, leading to weakened eggshells and population declines.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider the subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the overall meaning conveyed in the passage when choosing the correct answer.", "A": "accumulating", "B": "accumulates", "C": "accumulated", "D": "had accumulated", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense accumulated is consistent with the historical context of the passage, which describes events that have already occurred and were documented in Carson\u2019s work.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present participle accumulating does not form a grammatically correct main clause in this context.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense accumulates inaccurately implies that the accumulation is happening currently, while the passage describes a historical phenomenon.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the past perfect had accumulated suggests a prior action relative to another past event, which is unnecessary in this context."}
