{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel recounts the extraordinary life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught Indian mathematician whose work revolutionized number theory. Despite having no formal training, Ramanujan ______ formulas that continue to influence modern mathematics and inspire new generations of mathematicians.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the historical and enduring impact of the narrative.", "A": "deriving", "B": "derives", "C": "derived", "D": "has derived", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense derived appropriately reflects the historical context of Ramanujan\u2019s contributions as completed events with a lasting influence on mathematics.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because deriving does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because derives implies the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical narrative.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has derived unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical focus of the sentence."}
