{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</em> by Dava Sobel (1995).", "text": "Sobel explores the life of John Harrison, an 18th-century clockmaker who revolutionized navigation with his invention of the marine chronometer. Before Harrison\u2019s work, sailors relied on inaccurate methods for determining longitude, leading to numerous maritime disasters. His invention ______ the accuracy of oceanic navigation, saving countless lives and reshaping global exploration.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the historical context of the narrative.", "A": "improved", "B": "improving", "C": "improves", "D": "has improved", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense improved accurately reflects the historical context, describing Harrison\u2019s completed work and its immediate impact on navigation.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense improves suggests that the action is occurring now, rather than being a historical event.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because improving does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence grammatically incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has improved implies a continuing relevance to the present, which does not align with the passage\u2019s historical focus."}
