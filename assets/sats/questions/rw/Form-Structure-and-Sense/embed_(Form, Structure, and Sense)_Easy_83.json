{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</em> by James D. Watson (1968).", "text": "Watson describes the collaborative effort to uncover DNA\u2019s structure, highlighting the importance of Rosalind Franklin\u2019s X-ray crystallography. These images provided crucial evidence for Watson and Crick\u2019s model of the double helix, which ______ the field of genetics and paved the way for breakthroughs in medicine and biology.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical alignment of the sentence with the historical context.", "A": "transforms", "B": "transformed", "C": "has transformed", "D": "transforming", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense transformed reflects the historical impact of Watson and Crick\u2019s discovery on genetics as a specific and completed event.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because transforms incorrectly implies that the transformation is happening in the present, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has transformed suggests a connection to the present that is unnecessary for the context of the discovery.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because transforming does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
