{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Right Stuff</em> by Tom Wolfe (1979).", "text": "Wolfe chronicles the bravery and determination of the test pilots who became America\u2019s first astronauts during the early days of space exploration. Their willingness to take extraordinary risks ______ the success of early space missions, proving that humans could endure the physical and psychological challenges of space travel.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the historical and technical context of the passage.", "A": "ensures", "B": "ensured", "C": "has ensured", "D": "ensuring", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense ensured aligns with the historical context, describing the pilots\u2019 efforts as completed actions that contributed to the success of the space program.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because ensures implies the action is occurring now, disrupting the historical narrative.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has ensured unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not relevant for the historical focus of the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because ensuring does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
