He discusses the advent of chemotherapy, which revolutionized cancer treatment in the mid-20th century. This innovation ______ a new era in oncology, offering hope to millions of patients around the world.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the sentence\u2019s alignment with the historical and medical context.", "A": "has marked", "B": "marking", "C": "marked", "D": "marks", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has marked connects the historical moment of chemotherapy\u2019s introduction to its continuing impact on cancer treatment and its relevance to modern medicine.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the participle marking does not provide a complete verb for the main clause, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the past tense marked confines the action to the past, missing the connection to its ongoing influence.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense marks inaccurately suggests that the event is occurring currently rather than reflecting on its historical significance."}
