{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2016).", "text": "Mukherjee details the history of genetic research, from Gregor Mendel\u2019s pea plant experiments to the discovery of DNA\u2019s structure. These milestones ______ scientists to decode the genetic instructions of life, leading to advances in treating hereditary diseases and understanding evolutionary biology.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the alignment of the verb with the historical and scientific narrative.", "A": "allowing", "B": "has allowed", "C": "allows", "D": "allowed", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has allowed effectively links the historical breakthroughs in genetics to their ongoing impact on modern science, emphasizing their continued relevance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies that the action is occurring currently, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allowed confines the action to the past, missing its connection to its present significance."}
