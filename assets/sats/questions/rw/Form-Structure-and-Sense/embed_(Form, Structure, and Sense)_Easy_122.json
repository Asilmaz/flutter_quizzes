{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2010).", "text": "Mukherjee traces the history of cancer research, detailing the shift from radical treatments to more targeted approaches. The discovery of oncogenes, genes that can drive cancer when mutated, ______ scientists to better understand tumor biology, leading to more effective therapies for certain types of cancer.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the alignment of the verb with the historical and scientific context of the passage.", "A": "allowed", "B": "allows", "C": "has allowed", "D": "allowing", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed accurately reflects the historical significance of the discovery of oncogenes and its influence on subsequent cancer research and treatments.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not needed for the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies the action is happening now, disrupting the historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
