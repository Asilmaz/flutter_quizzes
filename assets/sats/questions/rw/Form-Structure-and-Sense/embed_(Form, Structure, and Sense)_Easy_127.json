{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "Carson reveals the unintended environmental consequences of pesticide use, particularly focusing on the damage to ecosystems and wildlife. Her advocacy and research ______ a movement that led to greater environmental awareness, the banning of harmful chemicals, and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb fits the historical and environmental context of the passage.", "A": "sparking", "B": "has sparked", "C": "sparked", "D": "sparks", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has sparked connects Carson\u2019s work to its continuing influence on environmental movements, emphasizing its lasting importance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because sparking does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because sparked confines the action to the past, failing to emphasize its ongoing impact.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because sparks implies the action is happening now, which disrupts the historical focus of the passage."}
