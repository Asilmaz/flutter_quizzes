{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</em> by James D. Watson (1968).", "text": "Watson recounts the race to uncover the structure of DNA, focusing on the groundbreaking research and collaboration that led to this discovery. He describes how Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin\u2019s contributions were pivotal in providing critical X-ray images. These discoveries ______ the framework for understanding how genetic information is stored, replicated, and passed down through generations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and how the sentence fits the scientific context described.", "A": "laying", "B": "laid", "C": "has laid", "D": "lay", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid aligns with the historical context of the discoveries, describing their role as completed actions that established the basis for further advancements in genetics.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence grammatically incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has laid unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical narrative.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because lay is the past tense of a different verb, meaning to recline, which does not fit the intended meaning in the sentence."}
