{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</em> by James D. Watson (1968).", "text": "Watson details the collaboration and competition that led to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double-helix structure. He describes the critical role played by Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography provided crucial evidence for their model. This discovery ______ the field of genetics, transforming how scientists understand inheritance, disease, and biological processes.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical flow of ideas in the context of the passage.", "A": "transforms", "B": "transformed", "C": "has transformed", "D": "transforming", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has transformed connects the historical discovery to its lasting impact on modern science, emphasizing the continuing significance of the double-helix model.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because transforms incorrectly implies that the discovery is happening currently, rather than reflecting its lasting influence.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because transformed confines the action to the past, failing to capture its ongoing relevance.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because transforming does not form a complete verb for the sentence, leaving it incomplete."}
