{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em> by Elizabeth Kolbert (2014).", "text": "Kolbert examines how human activity is accelerating the rate of species extinction, describing it as the sixth extinction. She highlights how amphibians, the most endangered class of animals, are especially vulnerable to habitat destruction and climate change. The golden toad, for instance, ______ its ability to adapt to warming temperatures, leading to its complete disappearance in the 1980s.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Carefully consider the subject-verb agreement and ensure that the tense matches the historical context and factual accuracy of the statement.", "A": "had lost", "B": "loses", "C": "losing", "D": "lost", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense lost is appropriate for describing the golden toad\u2019s inability to adapt, which led to its extinction in the 1980s, aligning with the historical context of the passage.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the past perfect had lost unnecessarily implies that the loss occurred before another past action, which is not indicated in the sentence.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense loses suggests that the event is ongoing, which contradicts the fact that the golden toad became extinct in the 1980s.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the participle losing does not provide a complete verb for the sentence, rendering it incomplete."}
