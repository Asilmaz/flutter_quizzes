{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness</em> by Sy Montgomery (2015).", "text": "Montgomery explores the intelligence and emotions of octopuses, highlighting their ability to interact with humans and solve complex problems. She describes how octopuses use their highly flexible arms to investigate objects, manipulate their environment, and even escape from enclosures. This behavior ______ their problem-solving skills and curiosity, traits often associated with more traditionally studied animals like primates.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb form appropriately matches the subject and tense while aligning with the context of the passage.", "A": "illustrates", "B": "illustrate", "C": "illustrating", "D": "has illustrated", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The singular verb illustrates agrees with the singular subject behavior and maintains consistency with the present tense, as the passage discusses general truths about octopuses.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because has illustrated implies a past action with relevance to the present, which does not align with the broader focus on ongoing behavior.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because illustrate is plural and does not agree with the singular subject behavior.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because illustrating does not provide a finite verb to complete the sentence, making the sentence grammatically incomplete."}
