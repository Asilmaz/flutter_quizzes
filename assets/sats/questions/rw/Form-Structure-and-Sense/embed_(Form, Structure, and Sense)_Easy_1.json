	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Foundations of Architecture</em> by Yvonne Lind (2018).",
	"text": "Inspired by Gothic cathedrals, the architect incorporated ornate buttresses and tall spires. However, ______ the heavier framework, the building maintained a surprisingly airy interior.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider how to correctly position modifiers and maintain grammatical clarity.",
	"A": "in spite of",
	"B": "despite of",
	"C": "because in",
	"D": "despite",
	"correct": "D",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>D</strong> is correct because despite is the standard preposition signaling contrast. <strong>A</strong> in spite of is grammatically acceptable but needs of after it (which is not present in the sentence). <strong>B</strong> despite of is an ungrammatical combination. <strong>C</strong> because in does not express contrast and creates confusion."
