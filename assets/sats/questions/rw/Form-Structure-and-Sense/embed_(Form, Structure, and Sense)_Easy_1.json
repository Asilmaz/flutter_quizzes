{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> by Adam Smith (1776).", "text": "Every individual necessarily labors to render the annual revenue of the society as great as they can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it. By directing that industry in such a manner as to produce the greatest value, he ______ an invisible hand that promotes an outcome beneficial to society.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Carefully consider subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency within the context of the passage.", "A": "guided", "B": "will be guiding", "C": "has guided", "D": "guides", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The singular subject he agrees with the singular present tense verb guides. The passage describes a principle (the invisible hand) that is universally applicable and timeless, warranting the use of the present tense.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the past tense guided implies that the described principle is no longer in effect, which is not consistent with the ongoing nature of Smith's argument.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect tense has guided suggests a specific past action rather than a general principle that continually applies.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the future progressive tense will be guiding implies that the principle is yet to act, which does not match the context of the passage describing ongoing economic behavior."}
