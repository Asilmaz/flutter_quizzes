	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Historic Expeditions</em> by Gloria Park (2019).",
	"text": "British explorer Isabella Bird captured vivid accounts of her travels through regions rarely visited by Europeans. Her journals, filled with descriptions of rugged trails and local customs, ______ a window into nineteenth-century life across distant lands.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Take note of subject-verb agreement and the nature of the journalsâ€™ ongoing relevance.",
	"A": "provides",
	"B": "provided",
	"C": "provide",
	"D": "are providing",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>C</strong> is correct because journals is a plural subject, and the present tense provide indicates these writings remain accessible and relevant. <strong>A</strong> provides is singular. <strong>B</strong> provided confines the effect to the past tense only. <strong>D</strong> are providing is possible but less concise and shifts the tone unnecessarily."
