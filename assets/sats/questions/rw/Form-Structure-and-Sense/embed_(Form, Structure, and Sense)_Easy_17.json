{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> by Richard Rhodes (1986).", "text": "During the Manhattan Project, scientists worked tirelessly to harness the power of nuclear fission. At the core of their experiments, uranium atoms were bombarded with neutrons, causing them to split and release enormous amounts of energy. These reactions continued in a chain until they ______ critical mass, triggering a self-sustaining nuclear reaction that fueled the bomb.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb chosen aligns with the subject and reflects the proper tense to describe the sequence of events.", "A": "reached", "B": "reach", "C": "reaching", "D": "had reached", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense reached aligns with the historical narrative of the Manhattan Project, which describes events that occurred during the development of nuclear weapons.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle reaching does not provide a complete verb for the main clause, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense reach disrupts the past narrative, suggesting the event is occurring now rather than during the Manhattan Project.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the past perfect had reached implies a prior action relative to another past event, which is unnecessary in this sentence."}
