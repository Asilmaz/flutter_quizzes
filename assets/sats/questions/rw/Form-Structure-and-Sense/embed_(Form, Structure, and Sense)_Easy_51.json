{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson (2003).", "text": "Bryson examines scientific discoveries that shaped our understanding of the world, often highlighting the persistence and ingenuity of researchers. He describes how geologists determined the age of the Earth using radiometric dating techniques. This discovery ______ the foundation for understanding Earth\u2019s history, allowing scientists to piece together events from billions of years ago.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the broader historical and scientific context of the sentence.", "A": "lay", "B": "laid", "C": "has laid", "D": "laying", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has laid reflects the continuing relevance of the discovery, connecting the past event of determining Earth\u2019s age to its ongoing significance in understanding geology.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because lay refers to the action of reclining, not the act of establishing a foundation.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the past tense laid confines the action to the past, overlooking its continued importance.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the participle laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
