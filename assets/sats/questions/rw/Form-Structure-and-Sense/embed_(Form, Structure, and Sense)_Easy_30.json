{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2016).", "text": "Mukherjee chronicles the history of genetic research, from Mendel\u2019s early experiments with pea plants to the discovery of DNA\u2019s structure. He emphasizes the profound impact of genetic science on medicine, agriculture, and our understanding of inheritance. For example, the mapping of the human genome ______ new possibilities for diagnosing and treating genetic disorders, transforming the field of medicine.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider the relationship between the verb and the subject and ensure that the verb tense logically aligns with the narrative context.", "A": "open", "B": "has opened", "C": "opens", "D": "opening", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has opened reflects the ongoing impact of the human genome mapping on modern medicine while maintaining consistency with the sentence\u2019s forward-looking context.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because open is plural and does not agree with the singular subject mapping.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the simple present opens suggests a current action rather than an ongoing result, which fails to capture the continuity described in the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because opening does not form a complete verb for the main clause, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
