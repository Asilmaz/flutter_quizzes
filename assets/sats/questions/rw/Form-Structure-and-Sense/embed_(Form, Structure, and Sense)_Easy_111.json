{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Cosmos</em> by Carl Sagan (1980).", "text": "Sagan reflects on the vastness of the universe and humanity\u2019s quest to understand it. He highlights how the invention of powerful telescopes ______ astronomers to explore distant galaxies, revealing new insights about the cosmos and transforming our understanding of the universe.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific context of the passage.", "A": "allowed", "B": "allowing", "C": "has allowed", "D": "allows", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed correctly reflects the historical development of telescopes as pivotal tools that expanded the field of astronomy.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allows implies the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical focus of the sentence."}
