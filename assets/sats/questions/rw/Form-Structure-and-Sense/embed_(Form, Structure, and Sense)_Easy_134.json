{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking (1988).", "text": "Hawking discusses the groundbreaking theories of black holes and the universe\u2019s origin, emphasizing the importance of Einstein\u2019s general relativity. This theory ______ scientists to predict phenomena like gravitational waves, fundamentally altering the way we study space and time.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the alignment of the verb with the historical and scientific context of the passage.", "A": "allowing", "B": "has allowed", "C": "allows", "D": "allowed", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed reflects the historical nature of Einstein\u2019s contributions and their impact on scientific predictions at the time.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because allows implies the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical context."}
