	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Quantum Leap: Explorations in Physics</em> by Dr. Wei Li (2021).",
	"text": "The double-slit experiment demonstrates the wave-particle duality of electrons. Surprisingly, each electron, although fired individually, ______ an interference pattern over time, suggesting it interferes with itself.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider the singular subject electron and the continuing relevance of the phenomenon.",
	"A": "produced",
	"B": "produce",
	"C": "produces",
	"D": "will producing",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>C</strong> is correct because each electron is a singular subject and present tense (produces) is used to discuss a phenomenon still valid today. <strong>A</strong> produced places the event strictly in the past. <strong>B</strong> produce is plural. <strong>D</strong> will producing is grammatically incorrect."
