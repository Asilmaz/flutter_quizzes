{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</em> by Jared Diamond (1997).", "text": "Diamond explores the factors that allowed some societies to develop advanced technology and political organization faster than others. One key turning point was the domestication of plants and animals, which enabled sedentary agriculture. The cultivation of staple crops like wheat and barley ______ early civilizations to establish permanent settlements and support larger populations.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency, ensuring the sentence logically aligns with the historical context provided in the passage.", "A": "to enable", "B": "enabled", "C": "enabling", "D": "enables", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense enabled aligns with the historical context of early agricultural societies and the passage\u2019s past narrative, describing events that occurred in ancient times.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the infinitive to enable does not form a grammatically complete main clause in this context.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the participle enabling introduces a fragment rather than completing the main clause.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense enables incorrectly implies that the described action is happening currently, which conflicts with the historical focus of the passage."}
