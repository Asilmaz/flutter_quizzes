{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson (2003).", "text": "Bryson explores the scientific breakthroughs that have shaped our understanding of the natural world, focusing on the discovery of radiometric dating. This method ______ scientists to determine the age of Earth with remarkable accuracy, revealing it to be approximately 4.5 billion years old and reshaping geological research.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative.", "A": "allows", "B": "has allowed", "C": "allowed", "D": "allowing", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has allowed connects the historical development of radiometric dating with its ongoing relevance in modern geological research, emphasizing its lasting impact.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allows implies the action is happening currently, which disrupts the historical context.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because allowed confines the action to the past, missing its connection to present significance."}
