{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Gene: An Intimate History</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2016).", "text": "Mukherjee traces the history of genetic research, from Mendel\u2019s experiments with pea plants to the sequencing of the human genome. These advancements ______ scientists to better understand hereditary diseases, leading to breakthroughs in medical research and the development of personalized treatments.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative.", "A": "allowed", "B": "allows", "C": "has allowed", "D": "allowing", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed reflects the historical context of the discoveries in genetics and their role in enabling subsequent advancements in medicine.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies the action is happening currently, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for this context."}
