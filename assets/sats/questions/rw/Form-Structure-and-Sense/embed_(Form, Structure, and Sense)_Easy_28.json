{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary</em> by Simon Winchester (1998).", "text": "Winchester recounts the fascinating story of the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s creation, highlighting the contributions of Dr. W.C. Minor, an American Civil War veteran and asylum inmate. Despite his confinement, Minor sent thousands of meticulously researched word definitions to the project. His efforts ______ the immense task of documenting the English language, making it one of the most comprehensive dictionaries ever compiled.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb matches the subject and tense while maintaining consistency with the historical narrative.", "A": "was aiding", "B": "aided", "C": "aids", "D": "has aided", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense aided correctly reflects the historical nature of Minor\u2019s contributions to the Oxford English Dictionary project, aligning with the narrative of events that took place in the past.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because was aiding suggests an ongoing action, which does not fit the completed historical events described.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because aids is in the present tense, disrupting the past narrative and suggesting the actions are occurring now.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has aided implies a connection to the present, which is inconsistent with the historical context of the passage."}
