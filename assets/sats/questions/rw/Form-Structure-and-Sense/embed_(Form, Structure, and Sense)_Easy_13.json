{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</em> by Michael Pollan (2006).", "text": "Pollan explores how industrial farming, organic agriculture, and foraging shape the modern food system. He argues that the decisions individuals make about their diets are more significant than they might realize. For example, when consumers choose sustainably grown produce, they ______ a system that prioritizes environmental health and ethical farming practices, potentially influencing market trends and agricultural policies.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and logical alignment with the broader context of the argument when selecting the answer.", "A": "supports", "B": "supporting", "C": "has supported", "D": "support", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The plural subject consumers agrees with the plural verb support, and the present tense appropriately reflects the ongoing and general nature of the described action.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the singular verb supports does not agree with the plural subject consumers.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has supported unnecessarily suggests a specific past action rather than the general behavior of consumers described in the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present participle supporting does not provide a finite verb for the main clause, resulting in a grammatically incomplete sentence."}
