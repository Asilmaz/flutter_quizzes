	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Insights into Marine Biology</em> by Dr. Naomi Phelps (2019).",
	"text": "While observing deep-sea vents, researchers discovered new species of bacteria clustered around hot mineral outflows. These species, ______ to thrive in extreme environments, may inform the development of future biotechnologies.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Keep in mind the correct use of participles to describe the bacteria.",
	"A": "which enable",
	"B": "are enabling",
	"C": "enabling them",
	"D": "enabled",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>C</strong> is correct because enabling them succinctly describes the bacteriaâ€™s adaptation. <strong>A</strong> which enable requires a different clause structure. <strong>B</strong> are enabling disrupts the sentence flow. <strong>D</strong> enabled is past tense and does not smoothly modify the species in the present context."
