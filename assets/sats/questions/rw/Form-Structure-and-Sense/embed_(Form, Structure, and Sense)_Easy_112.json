{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel chronicles the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught Indian mathematician whose groundbreaking work in number theory transformed mathematics. His formulas and theories ______ mathematicians worldwide, inspiring further research and innovations in the field.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical alignment of the sentence within the historical context.", "A": "inspires", "B": "inspired", "C": "inspiring", "D": "has inspired", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense inspired accurately reflects Ramanujan\u2019s influence during his lifetime and shortly after, aligning with the historical focus of the passage.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because inspires incorrectly implies that the action is occurring currently, disrupting the historical context.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because inspiring does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has inspired unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not relevant in this specific context."}
