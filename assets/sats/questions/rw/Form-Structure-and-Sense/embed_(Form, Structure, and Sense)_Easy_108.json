{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em> by Walter Isaacson (2014).", "text": "Isaacson chronicles the breakthroughs that led to the birth of personal computing, focusing on the creation of the microprocessor. This invention ______ the development of smaller, more powerful computers, transforming how people interact with technology in their daily lives.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb fits the historical and technological context of the passage.", "A": "allows", "B": "allowed", "C": "has allowed", "D": "allowing", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed accurately reflects the historical development of the microprocessor and its role in enabling technological advancements.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies the action is occurring now, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not required in this context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
