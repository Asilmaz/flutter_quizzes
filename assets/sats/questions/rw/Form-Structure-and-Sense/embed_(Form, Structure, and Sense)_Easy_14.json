The present perfect tense has expanded is appropriate because it reflects the gradual and ongoing nature of humanity's increasing understanding of the cosmos over time, connecting the past with the present.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the past perfect had expanded suggests that the action was completed before another past action, which is not implied in the passage.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present tense expands suggests an action happening solely in the present, ignoring the historical context of the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the participle expanding does not provide a complete verb for the main clause, resulting in a grammatically incomplete sentence."}
