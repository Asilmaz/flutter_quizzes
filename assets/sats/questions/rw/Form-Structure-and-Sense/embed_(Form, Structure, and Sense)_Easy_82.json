{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em> by Walter Isaacson (2014).", "text": "Isaacson explores the collaborative efforts that led to the development of the first digital computers. The invention of the transistor, a tiny device capable of amplifying and switching electronic signals, ______ the foundation for modern computing, enabling the creation of faster and more efficient machines.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Ensure the verb tense and subject-verb agreement are consistent with the historical context and logical progression of the passage.", "A": "has laid", "B": "laid", "C": "laying", "D": "lays", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has laid connects the historical invention of the transistor to its continuing relevance in modern computing, emphasizing its lasting impact.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because laid confines the action to the past, missing the ongoing significance of the invention.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because lays is in the present tense, which disrupts the historical narrative by suggesting the action is happening now."}
