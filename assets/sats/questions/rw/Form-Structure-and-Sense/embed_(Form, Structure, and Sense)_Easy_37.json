{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "Carson\u2019s book exposed the dangers of pesticides such as DDT, which were widely used in agriculture and pest control. She explained how these chemicals accumulated in the environment, harming wildlife and contaminating water sources. Her work ______ public awareness about the unintended consequences of human actions, sparking a movement toward environmental protection and leading to significant policy changes.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Evaluate the verb form for subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and alignment with the historical and narrative context of the sentence.", "A": "raises", "B": "raised", "C": "raising", "D": "has raised", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The past tense raised aligns with the historical context, reflecting the impact Carson\u2019s book had at the time of its publication.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense raises disrupts the historical narrative, suggesting that Carson\u2019s actions are ongoing rather than part of a completed event.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle raising does not provide a finite verb for the sentence, resulting in an incomplete main clause.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has raised implies ongoing relevance, which is unnecessary given the sentence\u2019s focus on historical outcomes."}
