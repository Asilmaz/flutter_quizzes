{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Right Stuff</em> by Tom Wolfe (1979).", "text": "In the early days of the space program, test pilots and engineers worked together to overcome the immense challenges of manned spaceflight. These men and women operated at the frontier of technology and human endurance, navigating risks and uncertainties. When a launch was imminent, the engineers ______ tirelessly to ensure every system was operational, knowing the slightest error could jeopardize the mission.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and tense consistency, ensuring the verb aligns with the historical and narrative context.", "A": "were working", "B": "are working", "C": "worked", "D": "work", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past progressive were working accurately describes an ongoing action (working tirelessly) that occurred in the past leading up to the launch. It aligns with the historical narrative and provides the appropriate sense of time.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense work disrupts the past narrative, implying the action is occurring now rather than in the historical context.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present progressive are working similarly conflicts with the past narrative and the historical context.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the simple past worked does not convey the ongoing nature of the engineers\u2019 efforts leading up to the event."}
