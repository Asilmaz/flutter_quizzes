{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</em> by Walter Isaacson (2014).", "text": "Isaacson recounts the collaborative efforts of early computer scientists in creating the first programmable computers. This breakthrough ______ a new era in computing, paving the way for personal computers and advanced software systems that have transformed industries and daily life.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and technological narrative of the passage.", "A": "opens", "B": "opening", "C": "opened", "D": "has opened", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense opened accurately reflects the historical significance of early computer innovations while aligning with the context of the passage.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because opens implies the action is happening now, disrupting the historical focus.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because opening does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has opened unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for this context."}
