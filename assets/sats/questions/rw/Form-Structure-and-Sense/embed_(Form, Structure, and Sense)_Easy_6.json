	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Astrophysics in the Modern Era</em> by Dr. Isaac Reynolds (2018).",
	"text": "Probing deep space with advanced telescopes, researchers have observed faint celestial bodies that ______ beyond our current classifications, suggesting entire categories of stars remain undiscovered.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider whether the plural noun and the verb form agree.",
	"A": "exist",
	"B": "exists",
	"C": "were existing",
	"D": "existing",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>A</strong> is correct because the plural subject bodies pairs with the plural verb exist in present tense. <strong>B</strong> exists is singular. <strong>C</strong> were existing is past progressive and less appropriate for a general statement. <strong>D</strong> existing does not provide a main verb for the clause."
