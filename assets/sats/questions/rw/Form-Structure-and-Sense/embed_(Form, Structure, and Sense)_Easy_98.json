{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan</em> by Robert Kanigel (1991).", "text": "Kanigel tells the story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician whose innovative work revolutionized number theory. Despite limited resources, his ideas ______ significant advancements in mathematics, inspiring generations of researchers and shaping the field for decades to come.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical flow of the sentence within the historical context.", "A": "drove", "B": "driving", "C": "drives", "D": "have driven", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect have driven connects Ramanujan\u2019s historical contributions to their ongoing impact in the field of mathematics, emphasizing their continuing significance.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because driving does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because drives implies the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical narrative.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because drove confines the action to the past, missing the ongoing influence of Ramanujan\u2019s work."}
