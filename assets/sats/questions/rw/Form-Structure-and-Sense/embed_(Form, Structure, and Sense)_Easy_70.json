{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration</em> by Isabel Wilkerson (2010).", "text": "Wilkerson examines the migration of millions of African Americans from the rural South to urban areas in the North and West during the 20th century. This migration ______ profound cultural, social, and economic changes in the United States, reshaping cities and challenging the systems of segregation and discrimination.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the historical context of the narrative.", "A": "produces", "B": "has produced", "C": "produced", "D": "producing", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense produced reflects the historical context of the migration, describing its impact as a completed event with lasting consequences.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because produces incorrectly implies the migration is occurring now rather than being a historical event.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because has produced unnecessarily connects the event to the present, which is not required for the context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because producing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
