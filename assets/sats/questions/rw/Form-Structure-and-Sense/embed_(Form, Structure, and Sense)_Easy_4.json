	"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Symbolism in Renaissance Painting</em> by Maria E. Turner (2020).",
	"text": "Many Renaissance artists encoded philosophical ideas into their work, tucking hidden references into landscapes, clothing patterns, or background figures. This layered approach, though subtle, ______ the eraâ€™s fascination with allegory and deeper meaning.",
	"question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Concentrate on subject-verb agreement and the historical context provided.",
	"A": "demonstrating",
	"B": "demonstrates",
	"C": "demonstration of",
	"D": "will demonstrating",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice <strong>B</strong> is correct. The subject This layered approach is singular and requires the singular verb demonstrates in present tense, reflecting a general truth about Renaissance art. <strong>A</strong> demonstrating is a participle that would leave the clause incomplete. <strong>C</strong> demonstration of incorrectly changes the structure and omits a needed verb. <strong>D</strong> will demonstrating is not grammatically valid."
