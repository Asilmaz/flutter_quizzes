{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Story of My Experiments with Truth</em> by Mahatma Gandhi (1927).", "text": "During his time in South Africa, Gandhi devised a new method of protest he called Satyagraha, or truth force, which was rooted in principles of nonviolent resistance. Satyagraha was a revolutionary concept that reshaped how civil disobedience was perceived worldwide. For Gandhi, the success of this approach ______ on the unwavering commitment to truth and the courage to endure suffering without retaliation.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and logical coherence with the provided historical context when selecting your answer.", "A": "depend", "B": "has depended", "C": "depends", "D": "will depend", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The singular subject the success agrees with the singular present tense verb depends. The present tense is appropriate because the passage discusses Gandhi's principles as ongoing and universally relevant.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the plural verb depend does not agree with the singular subject the success.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has depended unnecessarily suggests a past action with continued relevance, which is inconsistent with the timeless principle being described.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the future tense will depend implies that the concept\u2019s validity is yet to be tested, which contradicts the established historical and philosophical significance of Satyagraha."}
