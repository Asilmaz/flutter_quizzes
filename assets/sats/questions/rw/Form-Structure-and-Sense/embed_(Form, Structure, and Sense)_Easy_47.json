{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> by Rebecca Skloot (2010).", "text": "Henrietta Lacks, a young African American woman, became unknowingly central to one of the greatest scientific advancements of the 20th century. Her cells, known as HeLa cells, were the first to survive and reproduce indefinitely in a laboratory setting. These cells ______ countless breakthroughs in medicine, including the development of the polio vaccine, cancer treatments, and in-vitro fertilization.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, verb tense, and the broader scientific context provided in the passage.", "A": "enabling", "B": "enabled", "C": "have enabled", "D": "enable", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense enabled correctly aligns with the historical context of the passage, describing how HeLa cells contributed to past medical breakthroughs.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because enabling does not form a complete verb for the sentence and leaves it grammatically incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because have enabled implies an ongoing action rather than focusing on the historical contributions highlighted in the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present tense enable disrupts the historical focus and suggests that the breakthroughs are occurring currently, rather than in the past."}
