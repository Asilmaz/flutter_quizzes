{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em> (1791).", "text": "Franklin recounts his early years as an apprentice in his brother\u2019s printing house, where he learned the skills that would later define his career. Despite their frequent disagreements, Franklin gained invaluable experience and began to develop his own ideas about writing and publishing. After leaving his brother\u2019s service, he ______ to establish a successful printing business of his own, which eventually led to his prominence as a publisher and statesman.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider tense consistency and subject-verb agreement to ensure the sentence is grammatically accurate and logically coherent.", "A": "resolves", "B": "resolving", "C": "has resolved", "D": "resolved", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>B</strong> is the best answer. The past tense resolved is consistent with the past tense narrative describing Franklin\u2019s life and career development. The use of resolved indicates that this decision occurred at a specific point in Franklin\u2019s past.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the present tense resolves disrupts the narrative\u2019s past tense continuity and implies that Franklin\u2019s decision is occurring in the present.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has resolved suggests a past action with continued relevance, which is unnecessary given the clear historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present participle resolving does not provide a finite verb to complete the sentence\u2019s main clause."}
