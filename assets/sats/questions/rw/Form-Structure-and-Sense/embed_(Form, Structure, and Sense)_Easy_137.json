{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee (2010).", "text": "Mukherjee details the evolution of cancer treatments, from surgery to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The discovery of targeted therapies ______ a new era in cancer treatment, enabling doctors to attack specific genetic mutations responsible for the disease while sparing healthy cells.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific narrative.", "A": "ushered", "B": "ushering", "C": "ushers", "D": "has ushered", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense ushered accurately reflects the historical moment when targeted therapies revolutionized cancer treatment, aligning with the passage's historical focus.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because has ushered unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required in this context.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because ushering does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because ushers implies that the action is occurring now, disrupting the historical focus."}
