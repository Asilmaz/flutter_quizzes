{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</em> by Dava Sobel (1995).", "text": "Sobel recounts the struggles of John Harrison, an 18th-century clockmaker, who invented the marine chronometer to solve the problem of determining longitude at sea. Harrison\u2019s invention ______ navigation by providing sailors with an accurate way to calculate their position, revolutionizing maritime travel and saving countless lives.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and the sentence\u2019s logical alignment with the historical context.", "A": "transforming", "B": "transforms", "C": "has transformed", "D": "transformed", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense transformed aligns with the historical narrative, appropriately describing Harrison\u2019s contribution as a completed event with lasting implications for navigation.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle transforming does not form a complete verb for the main clause, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense transforms disrupts the historical focus and implies that the action is occurring now rather than in the past.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has transformed suggests a recent action or connection to the present, which is unnecessary in the historical context."}
