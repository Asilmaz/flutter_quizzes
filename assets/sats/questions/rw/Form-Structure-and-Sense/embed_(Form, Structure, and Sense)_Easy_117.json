This discovery ______ researchers to develop treatments targeting the genetic mutations responsible for cancer, reshaping the way the disease is understood and managed.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the alignment of the verb with the historical and scientific narrative.", "A": "allowing", "B": "allowed", "C": "allows", "D": "has allowed", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has allowed connects the discovery of DNA\u2019s role with its ongoing influence on cancer research and treatment development, emphasizing its lasting importance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allowed confines the action to the past, failing to emphasize its continued relevance.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because allows incorrectly implies the action is occurring currently, disrupting the historical focus."}
