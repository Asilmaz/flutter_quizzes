The domestication of animals and plants ______ certain societies to advance technologically and politically, giving them advantages in shaping global history.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the broader historical context presented in the sentence.", "A": "allows", "B": "allowed", "C": "allowing", "D": "has allowed", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has allowed connects the historical significance of domestication with its continuing influence on understanding societal development, emphasizing its lasting relevance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allows implies the action is occurring now, which does not align with the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allowed confines the action to the past, missing its ongoing significance.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb and leaves the sentence incomplete."}
