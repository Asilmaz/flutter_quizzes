{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking (1988).", "text": "Hawking explores the history of the universe, highlighting pivotal scientific discoveries about black holes, time, and space. He explains how Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity ______ the way physicists think about gravity, fundamentally altering the study of cosmology and our understanding of the cosmos.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the logical alignment of the sentence with the historical and scientific context.", "A": "transforms", "B": "transforming", "C": "has transformed", "D": "transformed", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has transformed bridges Einstein\u2019s discovery with its lasting and ongoing impact on physics and cosmology, emphasizing its enduring significance.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because transforms implies the action is happening now, which disrupts the historical focus of the sentence.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because transforming does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because transformed confines the action to the past, missing the ongoing relevance of Einstein\u2019s theory."}
