{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson (1962).", "text": "Carson\u2019s groundbreaking work exposed the dangers of chemical pesticides like DDT, which were widely used in agriculture during the mid-20th century. She detailed how these chemicals accumulated in the environment, harming wildlife and disrupting ecosystems. Her book ______ public concern about environmental issues, leading to the eventual ban of DDT and the birth of the modern environmental movement.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the broader historical context of the sentence.", "A": "raising", "B": "raised", "C": "raises", "D": "has raised", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense raised aligns with the historical context of the publication of <em>Silent Spring</em> as a completed event that had a significant impact on public attitudes.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the participle raising does not provide a complete verb, leaving the sentence grammatically incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense raises incorrectly suggests that Carson\u2019s book is being published or having its primary effect now.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the present perfect has raised implies ongoing relevance, which is not necessary for this context focused on historical impact."}
