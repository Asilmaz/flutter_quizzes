{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams</em> by Matthew Walker (2017).", "text": "Walker explores the essential role that sleep plays in maintaining physical health and cognitive performance. He highlights how REM sleep fosters creativity by helping the brain form novel connections and insights. Through extensive research, Walker illustrates how sleep deprivation ______ impair learning and memory, leaving the brain unable to function optimally.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Evaluate the grammatical structure of the sentence and ensure the verb form logically aligns with the broader discussion of scientific findings.", "A": "can impair", "B": "impairs", "C": "impaired", "D": "to impair", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The modal verb can introduces the possibility or capability of sleep deprivation impairing learning and memory, fitting the broader scientific and research-based context of the passage.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because the infinitive to impair does not provide a complete verb for the main clause, making the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense impairs suggests a general rule but lacks the nuance of can to indicate potentiality.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the past tense impaired does not fit with the ongoing and research-based discussion in the text."}
