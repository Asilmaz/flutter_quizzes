{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>Animal Architecture</em> by Ingo Arndt and J\u00fcrgen Tautz (2013).", "text": "Beavers are among the most remarkable architects in the animal kingdom. Using their strong teeth, they cut down trees and branches to construct dams and lodges. These structures not only provide shelter but also create ponds that help the beavers ______ their food and protect themselves from predators.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Consider subject-verb agreement and logical alignment of the verb with the context of the sentence while selecting the correct answer.", "A": "digest", "B": "to store", "C": "will digest", "D": "storing", "correct": "B", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The infinitive to store appropriately completes the sentence, describing the purpose of the beavers' actions. It logically aligns with the phrase help the beavers and fits the broader context of the passage.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because digest does not make sense in the context of storing food for later use.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the future tense will digest does not align with the purpose of the beavers' structures described in the passage.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because storing results in an incomplete sentence and does not correctly follow help the beavers."}
