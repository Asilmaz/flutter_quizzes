{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson (2003).", "text": "Bryson examines humanity\u2019s efforts to understand the natural world, including discoveries about Earth\u2019s formation. Scientists using radiometric dating techniques ______ that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, reshaping our understanding of geological and cosmic processes.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and the logical relationship of the sentence to its historical and scientific context.", "A": "determining", "B": "has determined", "C": "determines", "D": "determined", "correct": "D", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense determined appropriately describes the specific historical event of scientists calculating Earth\u2019s age, aligning with the context of the passage.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because determining does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has determined unnecessarily connects the action to the present, which is not needed for the historical context.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because determines incorrectly implies that the action is happening now, disrupting the narrative\u2019s historical focus."}
