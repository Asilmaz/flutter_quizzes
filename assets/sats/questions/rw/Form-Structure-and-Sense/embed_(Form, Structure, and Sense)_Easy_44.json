{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Soul of a New Machine</em> by Tracy Kidder (1981).", "text": "Kidder tells the story of a team of engineers working on the development of a groundbreaking minicomputer in the late 1970s. The project required extraordinary dedication and innovation, with team members often sacrificing personal time to meet tight deadlines. Their work ______ the rapid advancements in computer technology that revolutionized industries and reshaped modern life.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency, ensuring the choice aligns logically with the historical narrative.", "A": "symbolizing", "B": "symbolizes", "C": "has symbolized", "D": "symbolized", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>A</strong> is the best answer. The present perfect has symbolized reflects the ongoing significance of the engineers' work, connecting their past achievements to their lasting impact on modern technology.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because the present tense symbolizes suggests the action is occurring now, rather than reflecting on historical achievements with ongoing relevance.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because the participle symbolizing does not form a complete verb for the sentence, making it incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because the past tense symbolized confines the meaning to the past, ignoring the lasting importance of the work."}
