{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson (2003).", "text": "Bryson explores the vastness of the universe and humanity\u2019s quest to understand it. He discusses the work of early astronomers who determined the age of the Earth and its place in the solar system. These discoveries ______ the groundwork for modern astronomy, reshaping our understanding of the cosmos and our role within it.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the sentence\u2019s alignment with the historical and scientific context.", "A": "lay", "B": "has laid", "C": "laid", "D": "laying", "correct": "C", "explanation": " Choice <strong>D</strong> is the best answer. The past tense laid correctly aligns with the historical focus of the passage, describing these astronomical discoveries as completed events that fundamentally influenced modern astronomy.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because lay refers to a different action (to recline) and does not match the intended meaning.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because has laid unnecessarily connects the event to the present, which is not required in the historical narrative.<strong> Choice C</strong> is incorrect because laying does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete."}
