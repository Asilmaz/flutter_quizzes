{"introduction": "The following passage is adapted from <em>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</em> by James D. Watson (1968).", "text": "Watson recounts the process of discovering DNA\u2019s double-helix structure, a pivotal moment in molecular biology. This breakthrough ______ scientists to understand genetic coding, laying the foundation for advancements in fields like genetic engineering and personalized medicine.", "question": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English? Pay close attention to verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and how the verb aligns with the historical and scientific context.", "A": "allowed", "B": "allowing", "C": "allows", "D": "has allowed", "correct": "A", "explanation": " Choice <strong>C</strong> is the best answer. The past tense allowed reflects the historical moment of the discovery, aligning with the passage\u2019s focus on the event\u2019s significance at the time.<strong> Choice A</strong> is incorrect because allows implies that the action is occurring now, which disrupts the historical narrative.<strong> Choice B</strong> is incorrect because allowing does not form a complete verb, leaving the sentence incomplete.<strong> Choice D</strong> is incorrect because has allowed unnecessarily ties the action to the present, which is not required for this historical focus."}
