{"introduction": "", "text": "Psychologist Sigmund Freud argued in The Interpretation of Dreams that much of human behavior is driven by unconscious desires and repressed memories. Freud believed that by uncovering these hidden motivations, individuals can gain greater insight into their behavior and resolve inner conflicts, as many of these unconscious forces shape thoughts and actions without conscious awareness.", "text2": "Psychologist Carl Jung, however, believed that personal growth is achieved by integrating both conscious and unconscious elements of the psyche. In Modern Man in Search of a Soul, Jung argued that rather than focusing on repressed memories, individuals should strive to understand and balance their conscious desires with the symbols and archetypes that arise from the collective unconscious, achieving harmony within the self.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Jung (Text 2) likely respond to Freud\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on resolving inner conflicts through uncovering repressed desires? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that personal growth is better achieved by integrating both conscious and unconscious elements, focusing on harmony rather than merely uncovering repressed memories.", "B": "By agreeing that resolving repressed desires is the sole path to personal growth.", "C": "By asserting that unconscious desires have no influence on behavior or personal development.", "D": "By arguing that understanding conscious desires alone is sufficient for resolving inner conflicts.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
