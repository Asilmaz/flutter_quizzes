{"introduction": "", "text": "Environmental scientist John Muir argued that preserving large areas of wilderness is essential to protect biodiversity, as untouched ecosystems can sustain numerous species without human interference.", "text2": "Ecologist Aldo Leopold agreed that wilderness conservation is valuable but argued that sustainable human interaction, like managed forestry, can also support biodiversity without requiring complete preservation.", "question": "Which choice best describes a difference in how Muir (Text 1) and Leopold (Text 2) view biodiversity conservation?", "A": "Muir supports strict preservation, while Leopold advocates for managed human interaction.", "B": "Muir sees human interaction as crucial, while Leopold prefers preservation.", "C": "Leopold views biodiversity as irrelevant, while Muir sees it as essential.", "D": "Leopold and Muir both support unrestricted human activities in preserved areas.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Muir argues for strict preservation, while Leopold supports conservation efforts that incorporate sustainable human activity.Choice A is incorrect; Muir supports preservation, not human interaction.Choice C is incorrect; both authors see biodiversity as essential.Choice D is incorrect; both authors advocate for responsible approaches."}
