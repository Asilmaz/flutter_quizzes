{"introduction": "", "text": "Environmental scientist James Lovelock proposed the \u201cGaia Hypothesis,\u201d suggesting that Earth\u2019s ecosystems function as a self-regulating system that maintains conditions necessary for life, akin to a living organism.", "text2": "Ecologist William Dritsch criticized the Gaia Hypothesis, arguing that while ecosystems interact, they do not form a single self-regulating system. Instead, environmental stability results from complex interactions without intentional balance.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Dritsch (Text 2) likely respond to Lovelock\u2019s (Text 1) Gaia Hypothesis? Provide reasoning for your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that ecosystems function as a single self-regulating organism.", "B": "By asserting that ecosystems cannot interact meaningfully at all.", "C": "By arguing that environmental stability is not a product of intentional regulation.", "D": "By suggesting that Earth\u2019s ecosystems actively control planetary stability.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Dritsch critiques the Gaia Hypothesis by arguing that stability results from interactions rather than intentional regulation, countering Lovelock\u2019s view of Earth as a self-regulating system.Choice A is incorrect; Dritsch disagrees with the concept of a single self-regulating system.Choice C is incorrect; Dritsch acknowledges ecosystem interactions.Choice D is incorrect; Dritsch does not see ecosystems as actively controlling stability."}
