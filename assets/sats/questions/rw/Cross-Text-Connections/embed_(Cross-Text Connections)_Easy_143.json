{"introduction": "", "text": "Poet T.S. Eliot argued that modern poetry should reflect the fragmented, often chaotic experience of modern life. In The Waste Land, Eliot employed disjointed imagery, multiple voices, and abrupt shifts in tone to capture the confusion and uncertainty of contemporary existence. He believed that poetry must mirror the disordered nature of the modern world to connect authentically with readers.", "text2": "Poet Robert Frost, however, valued clarity and simplicity in poetry. Frost argued that poetry should be accessible and rooted in universal themes like nature and human relationships. He believed that direct and clear expression allowed readers to connect more meaningfully, without requiring complex or fragmented structures that might alienate or confuse them.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Frost (Text 2) likely respond to Eliot\u2019s (Text 1) use of fragmented structure to convey the essence of modern life? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that fragmented structure is necessary to make poetry relevant to modern readers.", "B": "By suggesting that poetry should use clear and accessible language, focusing on universal themes rather than disjointed forms.", "C": "By asserting that poetry must be abstract and incomprehensible to fully capture modern life.", "D": "By arguing that fragmented poetry fails to communicate meaningful ideas and should be avoided.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Frost values simplicity and accessibility in poetry, contrasting with Eliot\u2019s preference for complex, fragmented structures to capture modern life\u2019s essence.Choice A is incorrect; Frost does not see fragmented structure as necessary for relevance.Choice C is incorrect; Frost does not advocate for poetry to be abstract or incomprehensible.Choice D is incorrect; while Frost may find fragmented poetry less accessible, he does not argue it should be entirely avoided."}
