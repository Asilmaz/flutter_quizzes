{"introduction": "", "text": "Renaissance painter Sofonisba Anguissola was known for her innovative self-portraits, which often showed her engaged in activities like painting or playing music, a unique approach for women artists of her time. One early self-portrait shows her painting a canvas, emphasizing her identity as an artist.", "text2": "In Self-Portrait at the Easel, Anguissola is depicted holding a brush and palette, a rare representation for female artists during the Renaissance. Art historian Mary Garrard suggests that this painting represents a bold claim of professionalism and creative agency.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Garrard (Text 2) most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?", "A": "Renaissance self-portraits of women rarely showed them actively engaged in any activity.", "B": "The painting demonstrates a significant assertion of Anguissola\u2019s role as a professional artist.", "C": "Anguissola was likely the only woman artist of her era to depict herself painting.", "D": "Artists like Anguissola focused more on symbolic representations than realistic depictions.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "C is the best answer. Text 2 indicates that Garrard interprets the self-portrait as a bold expression of Anguissola\u2019s professional identity, aligning with the claim in Text 1 about her self-portrayal as an artist.Choice A is incorrect; Text 1 already describes Anguissola\u2019s activity-focused self-portraits.Choice B is incorrect; neither text implies she was the only woman artist depicting herself.Choice D is incorrect; no discussion on symbolic vs. realistic depictions is made."}
