{"introduction": "", "text": "Physicist Richard Feynman argued that quantum mechanics demonstrates the fundamentally unpredictable nature of particles at the atomic level. Feynman believed that the behavior of particles, such as electrons, cannot be fully determined and must be understood in terms of probabilities rather than certainties. This uncertainty, Feynman argued, is intrinsic to nature itself and challenges classical determinism.", "text2": "Physicist Albert Einstein, however, was skeptical of this interpretation. Although he acknowledged the importance of quantum mechanics, Einstein famously stated, \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe,\u201d indicating his belief that underlying principles must govern particle behavior consistently. Einstein maintained that quantum mechanics was incomplete and that a more predictable, deterministic theory could eventually explain atomic interactions.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Einstein (Text 2) likely respond to Feynman\u2019s (Text 1) acceptance of quantum mechanics\u2019 inherent uncertainty? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that nature is fundamentally unpredictable and cannot be understood with certainty.", "B": "By suggesting that there must be an underlying, deterministic explanation for particle behavior, even if it has not been discovered yet.", "C": "By claiming that quantum mechanics proves all particles behave randomly with no rules.", "D": "By arguing that classical physics can completely explain atomic interactions without quantum theory.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Einstein believed that despite current uncertainty in quantum mechanics, there must be an underlying deterministic model that could fully explain particle behavior, contrasting with Feynman\u2019s acceptance of quantum uncertainty.Choice A is incorrect; Einstein rejected the notion of fundamental unpredictability.Choice C is incorrect; Einstein did not claim particles behave without any governing principles.Choice D is incorrect; Einstein acknowledged quantum mechanics but found it incomplete, not entirely replaceable by classical physics."}
