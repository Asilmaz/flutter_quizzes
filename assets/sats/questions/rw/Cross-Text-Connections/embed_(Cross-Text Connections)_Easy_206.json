{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Sigmund Freud, in Civilization and Its Discontents, argued that human instincts, particularly aggression and desire, are suppressed by society\u2019s rules and norms. Freud believed that this suppression, while necessary for societal harmony, creates inner conflict, leading to discontent as individuals struggle between their primal urges and social expectations.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, posited that without a strong authority to impose order, human life would be \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\u201d Hobbes argued that individuals must submit to an absolute sovereign to control human instincts and prevent chaos, as unchecked natural impulses would lead to violence and disorder.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Freud (Text 1) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 2) assertion that an absolute sovereign is necessary to control human instincts and maintain order? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that human instincts should be freely expressed without any social or governmental restrictions, as this leads to genuine happiness.", "B": "By agreeing that absolute authority is essential to suppress individual desires and ensure peace within society.", "C": "By suggesting that while authority helps maintain order, societal rules create inner conflict and discontent, as individuals feel constrained by the repression of natural instincts.", "D": "By arguing that a moderate level of control is needed, but individuals are capable of self-regulation without absolute authority.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Freud would likely argue that while authority can help maintain order, the suppression of human instincts by societal rules leads to inner conflict and discontent, as individuals are often unhappy under such constraints.Choice A is incorrect; Freud does not fully agree with absolute authority, as he emphasizes the inner conflict it creates.Choice C is incorrect; Freud does not suggest unrestricted expression of instincts, as he acknowledges the necessity of societal norms.Choice D is incorrect; Freud does not imply that individuals can entirely self-regulate without authority but rather discusses the psychological costs of repression."}
