{"introduction": "", "text": "Psychologist Sigmund Freud argued that much of human behavior is driven by unconscious desires and conflicts. In The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud suggested that individuals are often unaware of the deeper motivations that influence their thoughts and actions, which can lead to internal conflict. According to Freud, uncovering these unconscious elements is essential for achieving personal insight and resolving psychological issues.", "text2": "Psychologist Carl Rogers, however, emphasized the importance of conscious self-awareness and personal growth. Rogers argued that individuals can achieve well-being by focusing on self-acceptance, empathy, and genuine relationships. He believed that personal fulfillment comes from consciously embracing one\u2019s identity and values rather than exploring hidden, unconscious motives.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rogers (Text 2) likely respond to Freud\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on uncovering unconscious desires as essential for personal insight? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that unconscious desires have no impact on personal development or psychological well-being.", "B": "By agreeing that understanding unconscious desires is essential for resolving psychological issues.", "C": "By suggesting that personal growth is better achieved through conscious self-awareness and positive relationships, rather than delving into unconscious conflicts.", "D": "By arguing that psychological well-being is irrelevant to both conscious and unconscious processes.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rogers believes that personal growth and psychological well-being are achieved through conscious self-acceptance and positive relationships, rather than by uncovering unconscious desires, which contrasts with Freud\u2019s approach.Choice A is incorrect; Rogers does not emphasize unconscious desires for resolving issues.Choice C is incorrect; while Rogers focuses on conscious growth, he does not dismiss unconscious influences entirely.Choice D is incorrect; Rogers views psychological well-being as highly relevant but believes it is achieved through conscious processes."}
