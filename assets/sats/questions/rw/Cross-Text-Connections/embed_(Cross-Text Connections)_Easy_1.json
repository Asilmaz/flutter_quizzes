	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Research indicates that novel nanohybrids can be more toxic than their individual components because conjugating materials like iron oxide and gold can produce unexpected physiochemical properties.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Some studies show that in certain cases, hybridizing materials can reduce toxicity. For example, a combination of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide can preserve optical transparency while mitigating harmful effects associated with zinc oxide alone.",
	"question": "How would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the concern raised in Text 1 about the heightened toxicity of nanohybrids?",
	"A": "Nanohybrids rarely change the toxicity profile of their constituent materials.",
	"B": "In many situations, combining materials actually leads to more severe harm to humans.",
	"C": "The same chemical reaction always occurs whenever different nanomaterials are conjugated.",
	"D": "It depends on the specific combination; toxicity may increase in some cases but decrease in others.",
	"correct": "D",
	"explanation": "Choice D is correct because Text 2 illustrates how certain combinations can actually reduce toxicity, implying that the effect is context-dependent. This directly addresses the potential for increased toxicity raised in Text 1."
