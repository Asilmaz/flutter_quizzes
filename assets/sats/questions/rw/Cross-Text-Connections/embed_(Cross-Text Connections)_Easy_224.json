{"introduction": "", "text": "In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith explains the concept of the invisible hand, arguing that individuals acting in their own self-interest often unintentionally promote the greater good through market efficiency. Smith asserts that minimal government intervention allows markets to allocate resources most effectively, benefiting society as a whole.", "text2": "In Das Kapital, Karl Marx critiques capitalism, asserting that the pursuit of self-interest leads to exploitation and inequality. Marx argues that unregulated markets enable the concentration of wealth among a small elite, ultimately creating societal instability and necessitating systemic change through collective ownership.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Marx (Text 2) most likely respond to Smith\u2019s (Text 1) claim that individuals acting in self-interest promote societal benefit? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that self-interest can contribute to market efficiency but emphasizing that its benefits are undermined by the exploitation inherent in capitalism.", "B": "By arguing that self-interest primarily benefits a small elite and often exacerbates inequality, contradicting Smith\u2019s assertion of widespread societal benefit.", "C": "By asserting that Smith\u2019s perspective overlooks the systemic instability caused by unregulated markets, which often fail to ensure equitable outcomes for all.", "D": "By suggesting that self-interest could promote societal benefit only if regulated by a system prioritizing collective ownership and equality.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "A is the best answer. Marx would critique Smith\u2019s belief in self-interest as a force for good, arguing instead that it concentrates wealth and power among a small elite, thus increasing societal inequality.Choice B is incorrect; Marx would not acknowledge efficiency as a significant benefit in unregulated capitalist systems due to his focus on exploitation.Choice C is incorrect; while Marx critiques instability in capitalism, his primary objection is the inherent inequality, not merely market failures.Choice D is incorrect; Marx advocates for collective ownership rather than framing self-interest as potentially beneficial under specific conditions."}
