{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher John Locke, in Two Treatises of Government, argued that individuals possess natural rights to life, liberty, and property, which governments are created to protect. Locke believed that when a government fails to safeguard these rights, citizens have the right to overthrow it, as the authority of any government is derived from the consent of the governed.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, contended that in a \u201cstate of nature,\u201d individuals\u2019 lives would be chaotic and dangerous without a powerful authority to maintain order. Hobbes argued that individuals should submit to an absolute sovereign who can ensure peace and security, as this is preferable to the fear and insecurity of a lawless state.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Locke (Text 1) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 2) view that individuals should submit to an absolute sovereign to ensure peace and security? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that while peace is essential, individuals have natural rights that must be protected, and authority should be limited and based on the consent of the governed, rather than absolute power.", "B": "By asserting that individuals should live without any authority or government, as self-regulation is sufficient for ensuring their rights.", "C": "By arguing that peace and security are irrelevant, as the pursuit of wealth and power is the only true purpose of government.", "D": "By agreeing that absolute authority is necessary to maintain order and prevent the chaos of a lawless state.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Locke would argue that while maintaining peace is important, individuals have natural rights that should not be compromised, and government authority should be based on the consent of the governed rather than absolute power.Choice A is incorrect; Locke would not support the idea of absolute authority, as he believes in limited government.Choice C is incorrect; Locke does advocate for government, albeit one that protects natural rights with consent from the governed.Choice D is incorrect; Locke\u2019s philosophy emphasizes the protection of rights, not the pursuit of wealth or power as the sole purpose of government."}
