{"introduction": "", "text": "Anthropologist Clifford Geertz argued that culture shapes individual behavior through shared symbols and meanings, which influence how people perceive and interact with the world. According to Geertz, understanding cultural context is essential for interpreting human actions, as culture provides a \u201cweb of significance\u201d within which individuals are embedded.", "text2": "Psychologist B.F. Skinner contended that behavior is primarily shaped by environmental conditioning, emphasizing reinforcement and punishment over cultural influences. Skinner argued that behavioral patterns can be modified by adjusting external stimuli, suggesting that understanding human actions does not require a deep exploration of cultural context.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Skinner (Text 2) likely respond to Geertz\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on cultural context in understanding behavior? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that culture provides a foundational framework for understanding human actions.", "B": "By suggesting that behavior is shaped more by direct environmental conditioning than cultural symbols.", "C": "By asserting that cultural context is irrelevant to understanding individual behavior.", "D": "By claiming that human actions are unaffected by both culture and environment.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Skinner focuses on environmental conditioning and reinforcement, indicating he would prioritize these factors over Geertz\u2019s emphasis on cultural context for understanding behavior.Choice A is incorrect; Skinner emphasizes conditioning over cultural influence.Choice C is incorrect; Skinner acknowledges environmental factors as essential.Choice D is incorrect; Skinner sees environmental conditioning as a key influence, even if he downplays cultural impact."}
