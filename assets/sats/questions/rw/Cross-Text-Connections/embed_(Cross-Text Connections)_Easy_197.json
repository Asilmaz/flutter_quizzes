{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Albert Camus, in The Myth of Sisyphus, described life as inherently absurd, characterized by the conflict between humans\u2019 desire for meaning and the universe\u2019s indifference. Camus argued that rather than succumbing to despair, individuals must confront the absurd by embracing it and living fully, finding meaning through their actions and defiance.", "text2": "Philosopher Viktor Frankl, in Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, emphasized that life\u2019s meaning comes from the purpose individuals assign to their existence, particularly through love, work, and resilience in the face of suffering. Frankl believed that even in the most challenging circumstances, humans can find meaning, which sustains them and gives life purpose.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Frankl (Text 2) likely respond to Camus\u2019s (Text 1) idea that life\u2019s absurdity must be embraced rather than resolved? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that the concept of absurdity is irrelevant because meaning is inherent in the universe, requiring no individual effort to define it.", "B": "By arguing that the only way to confront absurdity is by completely rejecting all forms of personal meaning and living solely for immediate experience.", "C": "By asserting that life has no meaning at all, and both the search for meaning and the defiance of absurdity are futile pursuits.", "D": "By agreeing that life\u2019s absurdity is unavoidable but asserting that individuals can overcome it by creating meaning through love, work, and resilience.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "A is the best answer. Frankl would agree that while life\u2019s absurdity exists, individuals can confront it by finding purpose and meaning through their actions, even in difficult circumstances.Choice B is incorrect; Frankl does not believe that meaning is inherent but that it must be created by the individual.Choice C is incorrect; Frankl emphasizes that meaning can and should be sought, even in the face of suffering or absurdity.Choice D is incorrect; Frankl advocates for finding purpose and does not endorse rejecting all forms of personal meaning."}
