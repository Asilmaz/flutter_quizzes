{"introduction": "", "text": "Conservationist Rachel Carson argued in Silent Spring that the extensive use of pesticides, especially DDT, poses a serious threat to ecosystems. Carson highlighted the risks these chemicals pose not only to wildlife but also to human health, and she advocated for stricter regulations on pesticide use to prevent environmental harm and protect public safety.", "text2": "Agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug acknowledged the potential environmental risks of pesticides but argued that they are essential tools for preventing crop loss and supporting global food security. Borlaug believed that pesticides, when used responsibly, play a critical role in feeding the world\u2019s growing population and preventing widespread hunger.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Borlaug (Text 2) likely respond to Carson\u2019s (Text 1) argument for stricter pesticide regulation? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that pesticide use is irrelevant to agricultural productivity and food security.", "B": "By asserting that pesticides have no impact on the environment or public health.", "C": "By agreeing that pesticides should be banned entirely to protect ecosystems.", "D": "By suggesting that while environmental risks exist, the benefits of pesticides in ensuring food security justify their responsible use.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Borlaug recognizes the environmental concerns Carson raises but believes that pesticides are necessary for food security when used carefully, contrasting with Carson\u2019s call for stricter regulation.Choice A is incorrect; Borlaug does not advocate for a complete ban on pesticides.Choice C is incorrect; Borlaug acknowledges environmental risks but finds the benefits for food production critical.Choice D is incorrect; Borlaug considers pesticides crucial for agricultural productivity and food security."}
