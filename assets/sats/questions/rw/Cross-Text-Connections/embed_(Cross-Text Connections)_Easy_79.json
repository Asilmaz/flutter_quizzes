{"introduction": "", "text": "Biologist E.O. Wilson argues that biodiversity is essential for ecological resilience, as diverse species provide stability and help ecosystems recover from disruptions.", "text2": "Environmental economist Robert Costanza acknowledges the importance of biodiversity but emphasizes that human interventions, like habitat restoration and pollution control, are also crucial in maintaining ecosystem health.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Costanza (Text 2) likely respond to Wilson\u2019s (Text 1) perspective on biodiversity? Provide reasoning for your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that biodiversity alone can fully sustain ecosystems.", "B": "By claiming that biodiversity is irrelevant to ecosystem resilience.", "C": "By arguing that biodiversity is valuable but needs support from human actions.", "D": "By suggesting that biodiversity harms ecosystem recovery efforts.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Costanza values biodiversity but believes human interventions are also necessary for sustaining ecosystems, adding complexity to Wilson\u2019s focus on biodiversity alone.Choice A is incorrect; Costanza emphasizes the need for human actions as well.Choice C is incorrect; both authors recognize biodiversity\u2019s value.Choice D is incorrect; neither author suggests biodiversity harms ecosystems."}
