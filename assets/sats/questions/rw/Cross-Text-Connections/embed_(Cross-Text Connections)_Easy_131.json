{"introduction": "", "text": "Political theorist Thomas Paine argued in Common Sense that government exists solely to protect the rights and welfare of its citizens, emphasizing that its power should derive from the people. Paine believed that when a government no longer serves its people, they have the right to alter or abolish it, as its purpose is to function as a tool for public good.", "text2": "Political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, on the other hand, contended in Leviathan that a strong, centralized authority is necessary to prevent disorder and protect individuals from their inherently self-interested tendencies. Hobbes argued that a government\u2019s power must be substantial to maintain peace and stability, even if this means limiting certain individual freedoms.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Paine\u2019s (Text 1) idea that government power should be derived solely from the people\u2019s will? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that strong, centralized authority is needed to maintain peace, even if it limits individual freedoms.", "B": "By asserting that government has no role in protecting the welfare of individuals.", "C": "By agreeing that government should only function as a tool for the public good, with minimal interference.", "D": "By arguing that people should have the right to overthrow any government they find unsatisfactory.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hobbes supports the idea of a strong central authority to maintain order and protect society, which often requires limiting individual freedoms, contrasting with Paine\u2019s focus on government deriving power solely from the people.Choice A is incorrect; Hobbes believes in centralized authority rather than minimal interference.Choice C is incorrect; Hobbes argues for government\u2019s role in maintaining societal order.Choice D is incorrect; Hobbes does not advocate for people\u2019s right to overthrow government freely, as he values stability above all."}
