{"introduction": "", "text": "Psychologist B.F. Skinner argued in Beyond Freedom and Dignity that human behavior is primarily shaped by external factors, such as rewards and punishments. Skinner believed that individuals respond to their environments in predictable ways, and that behavior can be modified by controlling these external conditions, reducing the role of free will in human actions.", "text2": "Psychologist Carl Rogers, however, argued in On Becoming a Person that humans possess an inherent drive toward self-actualization and personal growth. Rogers believed that individuals are capable of making free, conscious choices that align with their inner desires and values. He emphasized the importance of a supportive environment that fosters autonomy, suggesting that individuals have an innate ability to guide their own development.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rogers (Text 2) likely respond to Skinner\u2019s (Text 1) view that behavior is determined by external factors rather than free will? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that human behavior is solely a product of external rewards and punishments.", "B": "By suggesting that individuals have an intrinsic ability to make conscious choices that align with their personal values, emphasizing free will and self-directed growth over external control.", "C": "By asserting that behavior is unrelated to either free will or external factors, being completely random.", "D": "By arguing that personal development can only occur when external conditions control behavior without individual autonomy.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rogers emphasizes the importance of free will and self-directed growth, contrasting with Skinner\u2019s view that behavior is largely determined by external rewards and punishments.Choice A is incorrect; Rogers believes in autonomy and does not agree that behavior is solely shaped by external conditions.Choice C is incorrect; Rogers does not view behavior as random but guided by intrinsic values.Choice D is incorrect; Rogers believes in self-guided development rather than external control over behavior."}
