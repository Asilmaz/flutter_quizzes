	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Some new fungal protein sources, or mycoproteins, appear to have lower environmental costs than beef but may still be as resource-intensive as pork or chicken, limiting their overall environmental benefit.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Other researchers have shown that if mycoproteins replace even a fraction of beef consumption worldwide, the resultant decrease in cattle farming could significantly reduce deforestation, although total water usage might remain the same as cropping expands.",
	"question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the study mentioned in Text 2 regarding the global benefits of adopting mycoproteins?",
	"A": "They would insist that environmental costs of mycoprotein are always higher than beef production.",
	"B": "They would question whether substituting some beef with mycoproteins truly offsets resource use enough to produce major environmental gains.",
	"C": "They would wholeheartedly endorse the immediate replacement of all meat options with fungal protein.",
	"D": "They would propose that water consumption drops drastically once mycoprotein is introduced.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 1 acknowledges potential limitations of mycoprotein’s environmental benefits, suggesting skepticism about whether partial substitutions would yield drastic improvements. The other choices are inconsistent with Text 1’s caution."
