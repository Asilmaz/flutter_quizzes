{"introduction": "", "text": "Environmental scientist Rachel Carson observed that pesticide use disrupts ecosystems by harming insects crucial to the food chain. She argued that even small amounts of pesticides can have cascading effects, ultimately harming larger animals.", "text2": "Ecologist David Pimentel studied pesticide resistance in insects, noting that overuse leads to resilient pest populations. He cautioned that pesticide resistance causes farmers to increase usage, worsening environmental impacts.", "question": "Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?", "A": "Farmers are primarily responsible for environmental issues related to pesticides.", "B": "The environmental impact of pesticides is less significant than its benefits.", "C": "Pesticide use has unintended negative effects on ecosystems.", "D": "Insects have adapted to pesticides with minimal ecological disruption.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "A is the best answer. Both authors agree that pesticide use has negative consequences on ecosystems, whether through direct harm to the food chain or resistance in pests.Choice B is incorrect; both authors note ecological disruption.Choice C is incorrect; neither text suggests benefits outweigh impacts.Choice D is incorrect; responsibility is not assigned to farmers specifically."}
