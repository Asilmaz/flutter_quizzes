{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals that morality is based on adherence to universal principles. Kant believed that actions are ethical if they follow a \u201ccategorical imperative\u201d\u2014a rule that could be universally applied. For Kant, true morality involves acting out of a sense of duty, rather than considering the consequences or personal desires.", "text2": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, in Utilitarianism, argued that morality is determined by the consequences of actions, specifically the extent to which they promote happiness or prevent suffering. Mill believed that the moral worth of an action lies in its ability to produce the greatest good for the greatest number of people, rather than adhering to strict principles without regard for the outcome.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 2) likely respond to Kant\u2019s (Text 1) view that actions should be based on universal principles rather than consequences? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that actions should always be guided by universal principles, regardless of the consequences.", "B": "By arguing that individual desires should be prioritized over both universal principles and the welfare of others.", "C": "By asserting that moral actions have no connection to outcomes or principles, as they are entirely subjective.", "D": "By suggesting that the ethical value of an action should be judged by its ability to produce the greatest overall happiness, as morality is rooted in outcomes rather than strict adherence to principles.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Mill believes in utilitarianism, where the morality of an action is judged by its consequences and ability to promote happiness, contrasting with Kant\u2019s emphasis on adherence to universal principles.Choice A is incorrect; Mill does not support acting solely based on universal principles without considering consequences.Choice C is incorrect; Mill\u2019s utilitarian approach connects morality to outcomes, not subjectivity alone.Choice D is incorrect; Mill prioritizes the overall welfare, not individual desires over principles or the good of others."}
