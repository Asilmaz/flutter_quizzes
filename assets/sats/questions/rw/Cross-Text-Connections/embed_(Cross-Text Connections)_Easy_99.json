{"introduction": "", "text": "Environmental activist Rachel Carson argued in Silent Spring that pesticides, particularly DDT, harm not only pests but also ecosystems, disrupting food chains and causing unintended damage to plants, animals, and humans. Carson believed that the widespread use of chemicals in agriculture without thorough research posed a serious threat to ecological balance and public health.", "text2": "Agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug, known for his work on the Green Revolution, acknowledged potential risks associated with pesticides but argued that they are essential tools for protecting crops and preventing widespread famine. He believed that the benefits of increased agricultural yield and food security outweigh the environmental risks, especially in regions with high food insecurity.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Borlaug (Text 2) likely respond to Carson\u2019s (Text 1) concerns about pesticide use? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that pesticides should be entirely banned due to ecological risks.", "B": "By suggesting that while pesticides have risks, their role in food production is crucial, especially in food-scarce areas.", "C": "By asserting that pesticides have no impact on the environment or human health.", "D": "By arguing that the risks of pesticides far outweigh any potential benefits.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Borlaug acknowledges the risks Carson discusses but emphasizes the essential role of pesticides in ensuring food security, particularly in vulnerable regions.Choice A is incorrect; Borlaug believes pesticides are necessary and should not be banned.Choice C is incorrect; Borlaug does not deny the environmental risks associated with pesticides.Choice D is incorrect; Borlaug views the benefits of food production as outweighing the risks, not the opposite."}
