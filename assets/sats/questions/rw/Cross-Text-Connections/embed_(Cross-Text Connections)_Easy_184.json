{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued in The World as Will and Representation that human desires and actions are driven by an irrational and insatiable \u201cwill to live.\u201d Schopenhauer believed that this fundamental force compels individuals to strive endlessly for satisfaction, leading to inevitable suffering. He argued that only by renouncing desires and adopting a more ascetic lifestyle can individuals find peace.", "text2": "Psychologist Abraham Maslow, in Motivation and Personality, proposed the hierarchy of needs, where self-actualization sits at the top. Maslow believed that human motivation stems from fulfilling progressively higher needs, starting with basic physiological needs and culminating in self-fulfillment and personal growth. Unlike Schopenhauer, Maslow saw human desires as essential for achieving one\u2019s potential, rather than as a source of suffering.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Maslow (Text 2) likely respond to Schopenhauer\u2019s (Text 1) view that human desires lead to inevitable suffering? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that desires are irrational and should be completely renounced for inner peace.", "B": "By arguing that only basic needs, not higher aspirations, should be pursued to avoid suffering.", "C": "By suggesting that human desires are not inherently negative but rather a pathway to self-fulfillment and growth, as fulfilling needs leads to self-actualization rather than suffering.", "D": "By asserting that individuals should ignore both their desires and their needs, as neither contributes to personal development.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Maslow views human desires as part of a positive hierarchy that leads to self-actualization and personal growth, contrasting with Schopenhauer\u2019s belief that desires lead to suffering.Choice A is incorrect; Maslow does not advocate renouncing desires but rather fulfilling them as part of personal growth.Choice C is incorrect; Maslow values the pursuit of needs and desires for self-fulfillment.Choice D is incorrect; Maslow believes in the importance of both basic and higher needs in achieving self-actualization."}
