	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions were obvious but argued that certain other portions reflected the style of Philip Massinger, not Shakespeare, due to their depiction of women.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Scholars now generally concur that The Two Noble Kinsmen was indeed coauthored by Shakespeare and Fletcher. While there is some disagreement about exactly who wrote which lines, most agree that Shakespeare wrote the first act and much of the final act, while Fletcher composed most of the middle acts.",
	"question": "Based on the texts, which statement would both Sykes (Text 1) and the scholars in Text 2 most likely agree with regarding John Fletcher’s writing style?",
	"A": "It was difficult to distinguish Fletcher’s style from Shakespeare’s in The Two Noble Kinsmen.",
	"B": "It was distinctive enough to be recognized when comparing different sections of the play.",
	"C": "It lacked any notable hallmarks beyond what was conventional in Elizabethan theater.",
	"D": "It was excessively reliant on the depiction of female characters to convey plot points.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because both texts mention that Fletcher’s style stands out clearly—Text 1 says lines with Fletcher’s style were ‘obvious,’ and Text 2 notes scholars rely on stylistic differences when attributing sections of the play. The other answer choices either contradict details or introduce ideas not supported by the texts."
