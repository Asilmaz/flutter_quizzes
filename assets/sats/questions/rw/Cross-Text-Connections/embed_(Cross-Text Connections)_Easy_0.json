{"introduction": "", "text": "Historian Nancy L. Green explored the migration of Eastern European Jews to France in the early 1900s, noting that this wave of immigration significantly shaped French society. Green argues that, unlike immigrants from other regions, many Jewish migrants settled in urban areas, forming tight-knit communities that integrated into the economic fabric of cities like Paris.", "text2": "Anthropologist G\u00e9rard Noiriel studied immigrant communities in France and observed that immigrants typically face pressure to assimilate into French culture, often losing connections to their cultural roots. However, Noiriel points out that some groups actively preserve their traditions, creating vibrant, distinct cultural identities that enrich the broader society.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Noiriel (Text 2) most likely respond to Green\u2019s (Text 1) perspective on the integration of Jewish migrants?", "A": "Migrants from Eastern Europe were primarily focused on economic integration rather than preserving cultural identity.", "B": "Jewish immigrants likely faced similar pressures to assimilate but maintained aspects of their cultural identity.", "C": "Immigrant groups should be encouraged to live in isolated communities to retain their distinct traditions.", "D": "Jewish migrants were among the most economically influential groups in early 20th-century France.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "C is the best answer. Text 1 notes that Eastern European Jewish immigrants integrated economically while maintaining distinct communities, which aligns with Noiriel\u2019s view in Text 2 that some groups preserve cultural identity even amid pressures to assimilate.Choice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that Jewish migrants prioritized economic integration at the expense of cultural identity.Choice B is incorrect because Noiriel does not advocate for isolation of immigrant groups.Choice D is incorrect; economic influence is mentioned only in the context of integrating into urban areas without specifying Jewish migrants as uniquely influential."}
