{"introduction": "", "text": "Biologist Rachel Carson argued in Silent Spring that pesticides, particularly DDT, cause widespread harm to ecosystems, as they accumulate in the food chain and damage non-target species, including birds and fish. Carson warned that the unchecked use of these chemicals could lead to ecological imbalances and even impact human health, advocating for strict regulation of pesticide use.", "text2": "Agronomist Norman Borlaug acknowledged the environmental risks of pesticides but argued that they are essential for preventing crop losses and supporting food production. Borlaug believed that, without pesticides, global food security would be at risk, particularly in regions where agricultural productivity is crucial to prevent hunger and malnutrition.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Borlaug (Text 2) likely respond to Carson\u2019s (Text 1) concerns about the ecological risks of pesticides? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that pesticides should be completely banned due to their ecological impact.", "B": "By asserting that pesticides have no impact on ecosystems or human health.", "C": "By suggesting that while pesticides have environmental risks, their role in ensuring food security is critical, especially in areas vulnerable to food shortages.", "D": "By arguing that pesticides are only harmful to pests and do not affect other species.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Borlaug recognizes the environmental concerns Carson raises but argues that the benefits of pesticides, particularly for food security in high-need areas, outweigh the potential ecological risks.Choice A is incorrect; Borlaug does not support a complete ban on pesticides.Choice C is incorrect; Borlaug acknowledges environmental risks, even if he prioritizes food security.Choice D is incorrect; Borlaug does not deny that pesticides affect other species beyond pests."}
