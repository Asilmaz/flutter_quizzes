{"introduction": "", "text": "Historian Howard Zinn argued in A People\u2019s History of the United States that traditional historical narratives often ignore the voices and experiences of marginalized groups. Zinn believed that by focusing on the achievements of elites, history fails to represent the struggles and contributions of the working class, minorities, and women, which he saw as essential for a comprehensive understanding of society.", "text2": "Historian Daniel Boorstin, however, argued that history should emphasize the achievements of influential leaders and ideas, as these are the primary drivers of historical change. Boorstin believed that while the contributions of everyday people are valuable, history should focus on the impact of exceptional individuals and events that shape societal progress, as these are the elements that guide significant developments.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Boorstin (Text 2) likely respond to Zinn\u2019s (Text 1) focus on including marginalized voices in historical narratives? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that marginalized perspectives are irrelevant to understanding history.", "B": "By arguing that history should avoid focusing on individuals altogether, focusing only on collective social trends.", "C": "By suggesting that while marginalized voices have value, historical narratives should prioritize influential leaders and transformative events as the primary drivers of change.", "D": "By agreeing that marginalized voices should be the central focus of historical narratives.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
