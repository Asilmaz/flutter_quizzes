{"introduction": "", "text": "Sociologist Max Weber argued that the development of capitalism was largely influenced by the Protestant work ethic, which emphasized hard work, frugality, and diligence.

Braudel argued that capitalism developed as a result of practical economic forces rather than cultural or religious influences.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Braudel (Text 2) likely respond to Weber\u2019s (Text 1) argument that the Protestant work ethic was central to capitalism\u2019s development?
