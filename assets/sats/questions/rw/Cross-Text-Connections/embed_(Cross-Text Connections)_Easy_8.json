	"text": "Text 1: Adolphe Appia’s theory of stage lighting presupposed certain technical possibilities that did not become widespread until after the advent of modern electrical systems, raising questions as to whether his insights were purely theoretical.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Some historians argue that Appia was not merely theoretical. They note his apprenticeship under a lighting specialist, where he learned about handheld and portable lighting devices—technology that helped shape his practical understanding of stage lighting.",
	"question": "How would supporters of Text 2’s viewpoint most likely respond to critiques of Appia as lacking technical expertise?",
	"A": "They would concede that Appia was exclusively theoretical, having never worked on an actual production.",
	"B": "They would counter that Appia gained hands-on knowledge from his apprenticeship, informing his lighting concepts.",
	"C": "They would suggest that Appia based his theories solely on the invention of neon lighting decades later.",
	"D": "They would claim that technology for stage lighting had never been tested in real theatrical conditions.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 2 explicitly references Appia’s apprenticeship, demonstrating his direct exposure to practical lighting methods. The other options do not align with the details provided."
