{"introduction": "", "text": "Geologist Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift, suggesting that continents were once a single landmass that slowly drifted apart. Wegener based his theory on the similarities of fossils found on distant continents.", "text2": "Later studies in plate tectonics confirmed that continents move, but at varying speeds due to the forces of the Earth\u2019s mantle. Modern geologists now believe that these movements occur faster than Wegener originally theorized.", "question": "Which choice best describes a difference in how the authors of Text 1 and Text 2 view the movement of continents?", "A": "Text 1 views it as a sudden occurrence, while Text 2 sees it as gradual.", "B": "Text 1 suggests movement happens more slowly than Text 2 proposes.", "C": "Text 1 denies that continents ever moved, unlike Text 2.", "D": "Text 1 and Text 2 both see the movement as continuous but question the timeline.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Text 1 suggests slow drift, while Text 2 describes faster movement, contrasting their views on speed.Choice A is incorrect; both describe gradual movement, not sudden.Choice C is incorrect; Text 1 supports continental movement.Choice D is incorrect; only Text 2 questions the timeline."}
