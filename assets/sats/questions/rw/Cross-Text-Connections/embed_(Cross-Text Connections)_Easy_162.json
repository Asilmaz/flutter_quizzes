{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued in The Social Contract that individuals find true freedom by participating in the collective \u201cgeneral will,\u201d which represents the common good. Rousseau believed that aligning personal interests with this general will allows individuals to transcend self-interest, creating a society that is free and just, as each person contributes to the welfare of all.", "text2": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, however, emphasized the importance of individual liberty in On Liberty. Mill argued that true freedom arises from allowing individuals to pursue their own interests without interference, provided they do not harm others. He believed that individuality and personal autonomy are essential for personal development and societal progress, rather than conforming to a collective will.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 2) likely respond to Rousseau\u2019s (Text 1) idea that individuals achieve freedom through alignment with the \u201cgeneral will\u201d? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that freedom only exists when everyone follows the same moral code.", "B": "By suggesting that true freedom comes from personal autonomy and individual choices, without being compelled to conform to a collective will.", "C": "By agreeing that individual freedom is best achieved through alignment with society\u2019s common good.", "D": "By arguing that personal freedom requires strict adherence to laws that override individual preferences.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Mill emphasizes personal autonomy as the basis of true freedom, contrasting with Rousseau\u2019s view that freedom is achieved by aligning with the collective \u201cgeneral will.\u201dChoice A is incorrect; Mill does not believe freedom is found through conforming to a collective good.Choice C is incorrect; Mill supports diverse individual choices, not uniform adherence to a moral code.Choice D is incorrect; Mill values personal freedom and does not advocate strict adherence to external rules that override individuality."}
