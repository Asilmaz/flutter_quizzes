{"introduction": "", "text": "In Civil Disobedience, Henry David Thoreau argues that individuals have a moral duty to resist unjust laws. He emphasizes the importance of following one\u2019s conscience over obedience to government, even if it results in personal consequences. Thoreau advocates for peaceful resistance as a means to challenge systemic injustice.", "text2": "In The Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes argues that societal order depends on the absolute authority of a sovereign. He maintains that individuals must surrender certain freedoms to the government to avoid the chaos of a \u201cstate of nature,\u201d where life would be \u201cnasty, brutish, and short.\u201d", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Thoreau\u2019s (Text 1) claim that individuals should resist unjust laws in favor of following their conscience? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that resisting laws undermines the stability of society, as collective obedience is essential to avoid chaos.", "B": "By asserting that unjust laws should be amended by the sovereign, but individuals must obey them until changes are made.", "C": "By agreeing that moral conscience is important but arguing that societal order must take precedence over individual resistance.", "D": "By suggesting that the concept of \u201cjustice\u201d is subjective, and thus, resistance to laws based on personal conscience is flawed.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hobbes would likely contend that resistance to laws, even unjust ones, threatens the stability of society, which depends on collective obedience to a sovereign authority to avoid the chaos of the state of nature.Choice A is incorrect; while it recognizes societal order, Hobbes would not prioritize moral conscience over absolute authority.Choice C is incorrect; Hobbes does not advocate for individuals to wait for amendments but insists on absolute obedience.Choice D is incorrect; Hobbes emphasizes stability over subjective interpretations of justice, but his main focus is avoiding societal collapse, not dismissing justice entirely."}
