{"introduction": "", "text": "Art critic Clement Greenberg argued that abstract expressionism, as seen in the works of artists like Jackson Pollock, represented the purest form of art because it focused on form, color, and texture without attempting to depict reality. Greenberg believed that this approach allowed for an exploration of aesthetic qualities without distraction, elevating art to a purely visual experience.", "text2": "Art historian Harold Rosenberg, while also an admirer of abstract expressionism, felt that the movement\u2019s true power lay in the act of creation itself. He saw Pollock\u2019s paintings as \u201caction paintings,\u201d where the artist\u2019s movements and gestures became an integral part of the artwork, suggesting that the process and energy of creation were as significant as the visual result.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rosenberg (Text 2) likely respond to Greenberg\u2019s (Text 1) view of abstract expressionism? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that abstract expressionism is solely about the visual experience of form and color.", "B": "By claiming that abstract expressionism has no aesthetic value and focuses only on realism.", "C": "By suggesting that the act of painting and the artist\u2019s physical engagement are central to the meaning of abstract expressionism.", "D": "By arguing that abstract expressionism is entirely unrelated to the artist\u2019s creative process.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rosenberg emphasizes the importance of the artist\u2019s gestures and creative act in abstract expressionism, contrasting with Greenberg\u2019s view that the style is solely focused on form and color.Choice A is incorrect; Rosenberg sees the artist\u2019s process as integral, not just visual experience.Choice C is incorrect; Rosenberg values the aesthetic and expressive nature of abstract expressionism, though not focused on realism.Choice D is incorrect; Rosenberg believes the artist\u2019s process is central to the meaning of abstract expressionism."}
