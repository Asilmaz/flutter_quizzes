{"introduction": "", "text": "In The Republic, Plato describes the concept of the \u201cPhilosopher-King,\u201d arguing that rulers must possess wisdom and a love of knowledge to govern justly. Plato maintained that only those who understand the true nature of justice and the common good, through philosophical inquiry, are fit to lead a society effectively.", "text2": "In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes argued that a strong, centralized authority is necessary to prevent societal chaos. Hobbes believed that humans, in their natural state, are driven by self-interest and conflict, and only a sovereign with absolute power can ensure peace and security for all.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Plato\u2019s (Text 1) argument that rulers should prioritize philosophical wisdom over absolute authority? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that rulers should balance philosophical wisdom with absolute authority to create a just and secure society.", "B": "By agreeing that rulers must be philosophers, as philosophical wisdom is necessary to understand the nature of justice.", "C": "By arguing that practical governance requires absolute authority, as human nature is too self-interested to be guided by philosophical ideals.", "D": "By asserting that justice is irrelevant to governance, as the primary goal of any ruler should be to maintain order at all costs.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hobbes would likely argue that practical governance depends on centralized authority, as his philosophy emphasizes controlling human self-interest and preventing chaos over idealistic pursuits of justice.Choice A is incorrect; Hobbes would not agree with Plato\u2019s emphasis on philosophical rulers, as he prioritizes practical authority.Choice C is incorrect; while it appears balanced, Hobbes does not advocate for integrating philosophical wisdom into governance.Choice D is incorrect; Hobbes does not dismiss justice entirely, though he believes maintaining order is the primary goal."}
