{"introduction": "", "text": "Poet T.S. Eliot argued that modern poetry must reflect the fragmented, chaotic nature of contemporary life. In works like The Waste Land, Eliot used disjointed imagery and shifting voices to capture the confusion and disorientation of the modern world, believing that this style allowed poetry to connect authentically with the reader\u2019s experience of modernity.", "text2": "Poet Robert Frost, however, valued clarity and simplicity in poetry. Frost argued that poetry should be accessible and rooted in familiar themes, such as nature and human relationships. He believed that poetry gains strength when it is direct and clear, allowing readers to find universal meaning without complex, fragmented structures.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Frost (Text 2) likely respond to Eliot\u2019s (Text 1) use of fragmentation to capture the essence of modern life? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that poetry should focus on clear and accessible language, connecting with universal themes without relying on disjointed forms.", "B": "By agreeing that fragmented structure is essential to make poetry relatable in the modern world.", "C": "By asserting that poetry has no relevance to either modern or traditional themes.", "D": "By arguing that complex and fragmented poetry fails to communicate any meaningful ideas.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
