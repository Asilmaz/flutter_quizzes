{"introduction": "", "text": "Economist Thomas Piketty argues in Capital in the Twenty-First Century that unchecked wealth accumulation leads to economic inequality, as capital growth outpaces economic output. Piketty believes that this concentration of wealth among a small elite threatens social mobility and advocates for progressive taxes on wealth as a solution to reduce inequality.", "text2": "Economist Milton Friedman counters that wealth inequality is a natural outcome of a free-market economy, where individuals are rewarded based on their talents, skills, and entrepreneurial risks. Friedman argues that government intervention, such as wealth taxes, distorts market incentives and ultimately stifles economic growth and innovation.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Friedman (Text 2) likely respond to Piketty\u2019s (Text 1) call for progressive taxes on wealth? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that wealth taxes are necessary to prevent social inequality.", "B": "By asserting that economic inequality has no effect on social mobility.", "C": "By suggesting that wealth taxes interfere with market dynamics and hinder economic progress.", "D": "By arguing that wealth should be equally distributed by the government.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Friedman views wealth inequality as a natural byproduct of free markets and opposes government intervention, such as wealth taxes, because he believes they distort incentives and hinder growth, contrasting with Piketty\u2019s advocacy for wealth redistribution.Choice A is incorrect; Friedman opposes wealth taxes.Choice C is incorrect; Friedman does not claim inequality has no impact but supports it as an outcome of free markets.Choice D is incorrect; Friedman does not advocate for wealth redistribution by the government."}
