{"introduction": "", "text": "Political theorist John Locke argued in Two Treatises of Government that government exists to protect individuals\u2019 natural rights to life, liberty, and property. Locke believed that a government\u2019s legitimacy is derived from the consent of the governed, and if a government fails to protect these rights, citizens have the right to replace it.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, on the other hand, argued in Leviathan that a strong, centralized authority is essential to prevent chaos and maintain order. Hobbes believed that without a powerful government, individuals would act in self-interest, leading to a \u201cstate of nature\u201d filled with violence and insecurity, making individual freedoms secondary to societal stability.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Locke\u2019s (Text 1) idea that citizens have the right to replace a government that fails to protect their rights? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that the right to replace a government is essential for individual freedom.", "B": "By asserting that government authority should have no influence over the lives of individuals.", "C": "By arguing that citizens should have the unrestricted right to remove any government they dislike.", "D": "By suggesting that stability and order are more important than the right to replace government, as a strong authority is needed to prevent chaos.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hobbes believes that a strong, centralized authority is essential for societal stability, prioritizing order over the right to replace the government, which contrasts with Locke\u2019s emphasis on individual rights and consent.Choice A is incorrect; Hobbes does not prioritize individual freedom over stability.Choice C is incorrect; Hobbes advocates for a powerful government to maintain order.Choice D is incorrect; Hobbes does not support unrestricted rights to remove authority, as he values stability over frequent change."}
