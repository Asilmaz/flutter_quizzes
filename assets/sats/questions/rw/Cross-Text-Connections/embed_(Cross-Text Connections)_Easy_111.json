{"introduction": "", "text": "Political theorist Thomas Hobbes argued that in a state of nature, humans are driven by self-interest and competition, leading to a \u201cwar of all against all.\u201d To prevent chaos, Hobbes believed that individuals should surrender some of their freedoms to a powerful sovereign authority, which would maintain order and protect citizens from each other.", "text2": "Philosopher John Locke disagreed with Hobbes, arguing that humans in a state of nature are capable of cooperation and reason. Locke believed that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that the role of government is to protect these rights rather than impose absolute authority. Locke\u2019s ideal government derives its power from the consent of the governed.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Locke (Text 2) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 1) view on the need for an absolute sovereign?
