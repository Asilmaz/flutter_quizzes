{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Thomas Aquinas argued in Summa Theologica that faith and reason can coexist and support one another. Aquinas believed that rational thought can lead individuals to understand aspects of the divine, while faith completes what reason cannot fully explain. For Aquinas, both faith and reason are valuable paths to truth, each serving to enhance the other in understanding the world and God.", "text2": "Philosopher David Hume, in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, argued that reason and empirical evidence are the only reliable sources of knowledge. Hume was skeptical of metaphysical concepts and believed that knowledge must be grounded in sensory experience and logical reasoning. He argued that faith, being unprovable, should not be considered a valid source of truth.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hume (Text 2) likely respond to Aquinas\u2019s (Text 1) claim that faith and reason can coexist as paths to truth? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that faith alone is superior to reason in understanding truth.", "B": "By agreeing that faith complements reason in the pursuit of truth.", "C": "By suggesting that knowledge should only be based on empirical evidence and logical reasoning, as faith lacks a basis in observable experience.", "D": "By arguing that faith and reason are equally unreliable in the pursuit of knowledge.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hume believes that knowledge should rely on empirical evidence and reason, contrasting with Aquinas\u2019s view that faith and reason can coexist as paths to truth.Choice A is incorrect; Hume does not believe faith complements reason.Choice C is incorrect; Hume does not view faith as superior to reason.Choice D is incorrect; Hume sees reason as reliable, whereas faith is seen as lacking empirical grounding."}
