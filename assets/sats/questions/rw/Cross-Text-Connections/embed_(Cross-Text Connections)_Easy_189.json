{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Karl Marx, in The Communist Manifesto, argued that history is driven by class struggles, particularly between the bourgeoisie (the owners of production) and the proletariat (the working class). Marx believed that capitalism inherently exploits workers by extracting surplus value from their labor, leading to inequality and oppression. He advocated for the abolition of private property and the establishment of a classless society.", "text2": "Economist Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations, emphasized the benefits of capitalism, arguing that competition and the pursuit of self-interest drive economic efficiency and societal wealth. Smith believed that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market guides resources to their most productive uses, benefiting society as a whole, even if individuals act out of self-interest.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Marx (Text 1) likely respond to Smith\u2019s (Text 2) argument that capitalism benefits society as a whole through the pursuit of self-interest? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that capitalism is the most efficient system and creates widespread societal wealth without any drawbacks.", "B": "By suggesting that while capitalism may generate some wealth, it inherently exploits workers and concentrates power in the hands of the bourgeoisie, leading to inequality and class struggle.", "C": "By asserting that economic systems are irrelevant to societal outcomes and personal choices dictate prosperity.", "D": "By arguing that capitalism is beneficial but only when workers willingly accept their roles within the system.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Marx would argue that while capitalism may appear efficient, it inherently exploits workers and fosters inequality, directly opposing Smith\u2019s view of capitalism as beneficial for society as a whole.Choice A is incorrect; Marx does not agree that capitalism benefits everyone equally.Choice C is incorrect; Marx focuses on systemic issues rather than personal choices as drivers of societal outcomes.Choice D is incorrect; Marx does not believe that capitalism is beneficial under any circumstances, even with worker acceptance."}
