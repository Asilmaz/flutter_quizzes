{"introduction": "", "text": "Some art critics believe that abstract art should exclude recognizable forms to achieve true expression. This view aligns with early 20th-century artists like Kazimir Malevich, who avoided depicting familiar shapes to reach pure abstraction.", "text2": "Art historian Hilda Arnheim argues that pure abstraction limits artistic freedom. She suggests that blending recognizable forms with abstract elements enhances the viewer's engagement, as seen in Wassily Kandinsky's later works.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Arnheim (Text 2) likely respond to the critics in Text 1?", "A": "By agreeing that abstraction is most effective without recognizable forms.", "B": "By asserting that abstract art is more impactful with blended forms.", "C": "By arguing that recognizable shapes make abstract art less expressive.", "D": "By claiming that abstract art should prioritize simple geometric shapes.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "C is the best answer. Arnheim (Text 2) believes that combining abstract and recognizable forms enhances engagement, a stance contrary to the purist view in Text 1.Choice A is incorrect; Arnheim does not support strict abstraction.Choice B is incorrect; Arnheim advocates for recognizable elements to enhance art.Choice D is incorrect; geometric shapes are not discussed in either text."}
