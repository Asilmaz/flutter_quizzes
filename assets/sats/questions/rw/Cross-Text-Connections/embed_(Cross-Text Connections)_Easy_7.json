	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Current ecological theories struggle to explain how numerous species of microscopic phytoplankton coexist in ocean surface waters, where they appear to be competing for the same limited resources.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Some researchers propose that phytoplanktonâ€™s tiny size and sparse distribution reduce direct competition. Because the water is comparatively dense for such small organisms, they rarely collide or interact enough to outcompete one another decisively.",
	"question": "Based on the texts, how would advocates of the theory in Text 2 likely respond to the unanswered question noted in Text 1?",
	"A": "They would claim that resource competition is even more intense than previously suggested.",
	"B": "They would propose that direct competition is minimal, which allows for greater coexistence among species.",
	"C": "They would argue that phytoplankton do not actually need the same resources to survive.",
	"D": "They would deny that large populations of phytoplankton exist in the ocean at all.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 2 explicitly suggests that the minimal interactions among phytoplankton reduce head-to-head competition, allowing many species to persist. The other choices contradict or fail to address this logic."
