{"introduction": "", "text": "Literary critic Susan Sontag argued in On Photography that the act of photographing often distances people from their experiences. Sontag suggested that by turning moments into images, individuals become passive observers rather than active participants, as they focus more on capturing a scene than on engaging with it directly.", "text2": "Photographer Ansel Adams, however, saw photography as a means of deeper engagement with the world. Adams argued that capturing images requires a profound understanding of one\u2019s environment, as a good photograph reveals hidden details and evokes emotions.
