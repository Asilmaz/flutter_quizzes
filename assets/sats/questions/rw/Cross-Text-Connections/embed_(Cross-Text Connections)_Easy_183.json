{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher David Hume argued in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding that knowledge is derived from sensory experience and observation. Hume was skeptical of abstract reasoning and believed that all ideas come from impressions formed through the senses. For him, even concepts such as causation are based on habitual associations rather than any logical necessity.", "text2": "Philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, in Meditations on First Philosophy, argued that certain knowledge is achieved through reason and introspection, rather than sensory experience. Descartes believed that reason could uncover fundamental truths, such as the existence of the self (\u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d), which he claimed could be known independently of the senses.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Descartes (Text 2) likely respond to Hume\u2019s (Text 1) idea that knowledge is based entirely on sensory experience? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that foundational truths can be discovered through reason alone, as certain knowledge does not depend on sensory experience but rather on introspective clarity and logical deduction.", "B": "By asserting that knowledge is neither based on the senses nor on reason, but entirely random.", "C": "By agreeing that knowledge is purely based on sensory experiences without any need for reasoning.", "D": "By arguing that only sensory experiences are valuable, and reason has no role in understanding fundamental truths.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Descartes believes in reason and introspection as sources of certain knowledge, contrasting with Hume\u2019s view that knowledge derives entirely from sensory experience.Choice A is incorrect; Descartes values reason as essential to understanding, beyond sensory experience.Choice C is incorrect; Descartes does not view knowledge as random but as discoverable through reason.Choice D is incorrect; Descartes does not prioritize sensory experience over reasoning for foundational truths."}
