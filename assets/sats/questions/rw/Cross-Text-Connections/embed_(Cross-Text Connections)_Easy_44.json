{"introduction": "", "text": "Botanist Diana Beresford-Kroeger studied redwood trees, noting their need for specific coastal climates to thrive, as they rely on frequent fog for moisture and survival.", "text2": "Ecologist Michael Galli emphasizes that while climate is crucial, competition for resources among plants also restricts the spread of redwoods, often limiting them to specific regions.", "question": "Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?", "A": "Redwood trees require specific environmental conditions for survival.", "B": "Redwood trees thrive in a wide range of climates and regions.", "C": "Resource competition is unimportant to the growth of redwood trees.", "D": "Redwood trees rely solely on human intervention to thrive.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "A is the best answer. Both texts agree that redwoods depend on specific environmental conditions, including climate, for survival.Choice B is incorrect; both texts imply redwoods have limited regional range.Choice C is incorrect; Galli emphasizes the importance of resource competition.Choice D is incorrect; neither text mentions human intervention as necessary."}
