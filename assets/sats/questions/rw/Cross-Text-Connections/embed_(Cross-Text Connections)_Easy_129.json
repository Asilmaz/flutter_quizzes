{"introduction": "", "text": "Psychologist Carl Jung argued that understanding the \u201cshadow\u201d aspects of one\u2019s personality is crucial for self-knowledge. In Jung\u2019s view, the shadow represents the darker, unconscious parts of ourselves that we may deny or ignore. Jung believed that by acknowledging and integrating the shadow, individuals can achieve a more complete and balanced sense of self.", "text2": "Psychologist Abraham Maslow, in contrast, emphasized the importance of self-actualization, which he defined as reaching one\u2019s highest potential through positive growth and self-expression. Maslow believed that focusing on one\u2019s strengths and aspirations rather than dwelling on darker aspects led to greater fulfillment and well-being.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Maslow (Text 2) likely respond to Jung\u2019s (Text 1) focus on integrating the \u201cshadow\u201d for self-knowledge? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that focusing on the darker aspects of the self is essential for achieving self-knowledge.", "B": "By asserting that understanding the shadow has no relation to achieving self-knowledge or personal growth.", "C": "By suggesting that self-actualization is better achieved by focusing on strengths and aspirations, rather than integrating the shadow aspects of personality.", "D": "By arguing that self-knowledge is irrelevant to personal fulfillment and growth.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Maslow would likely view self-actualization as a process centered on positive growth and achieving potential, contrasting with Jung\u2019s focus on integrating the shadow for self-knowledge.Choice A is incorrect; Maslow emphasizes growth through strengths, not through focusing on darker aspects.Choice C is incorrect; Maslow does value self-knowledge, though through a focus on positive aspects.Choice D is incorrect; Maslow sees self-knowledge as highly relevant to personal fulfillment and growth."}
