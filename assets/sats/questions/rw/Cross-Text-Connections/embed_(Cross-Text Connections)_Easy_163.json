{"introduction": "", "text": "Physicist Niels Bohr argued that in quantum mechanics, particles do not have definite properties until they are observed. In Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge, Bohr suggested that the act of measurement plays a fundamental role in shaping reality at the quantum level. This interpretation challenges the notion of an objective reality that exists independently of observation.", "text2": "Physicist Albert Einstein, however, believed in an objective reality that exists regardless of observation. In The Born-Einstein Letters, Einstein argued that the universe is governed by laws that do not depend on whether or not they are observed. He famously stated, \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe,\u201d reflecting his belief that randomness and observation do not influence the existence of reality.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Einstein (Text 2) likely respond to Bohr\u2019s (Text 1) view that observation affects the properties of particles? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that particles possess definite properties regardless of observation, as the universe operates independently of human perception.", "B": "By agreeing that observation is essential to defining the properties of particles.", "C": "By asserting that the properties of particles are entirely random and do not adhere to any laws.", "D": "By arguing that the act of measurement is the only means by which scientific knowledge can be obtained.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Einstein believed in an objective reality that exists independently of observation, contrasting with Bohr\u2019s view that measurement affects the properties of particles.Choice A is incorrect; Einstein does not believe observation is necessary to define particle properties.Choice C is incorrect; Einstein believed in laws governing particles, not complete randomness.Choice D is incorrect; while Einstein values measurement, he does not consider it essential to establishing reality\u2019s existence."}
