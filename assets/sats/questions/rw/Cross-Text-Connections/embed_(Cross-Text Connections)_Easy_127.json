{"introduction": "", "text": "Art critic Susan Sontag argued that photography has a distancing effect, capturing moments without fully engaging with them. In On Photography, Sontag suggested that the act of photographing can reduce the richness of an experience, turning it into a mere image rather than a lived moment. She believed that this detachment leads people to view life through the lens rather than directly experiencing it.", "text2": "Photographer Ansel Adams, however, saw photography as a means of deep engagement with the subject. Adams believed that capturing a scene requires intense observation and a profound connection to the moment, allowing photographers to see details and qualities that might otherwise go unnoticed. For Adams, photography enhances awareness and brings a unique depth to the experience of seeing.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Adams (Text 2) likely respond to Sontag\u2019s (Text 1) view on photography as creating distance from experience?
