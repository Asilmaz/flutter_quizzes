{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued in The Social Contract that individuals achieve freedom by participating in a collective \u201cgeneral will\u201d that represents the common good. Rousseau believed that by aligning personal interests with the general will, individuals become truly free, as they are contributing to the welfare of society rather than pursuing self-interest alone.", "text2": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, however, emphasized the importance of individual liberty and personal autonomy in On Liberty. Mill argued that true freedom is achieved when individuals are allowed to pursue their own interests without interference, provided they do not harm others. For Mill, individual freedom is essential for personal growth and societal progress, rather than aligning with a collective will.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 2) likely respond to Rousseau\u2019s (Text 1) concept of freedom as aligning with the \u201cgeneral will\u201d? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that freedom is best achieved through alignment with society\u2019s common good.", "B": "By asserting that freedom only exists when all individuals conform to societal standards.", "C": "By arguing that freedom requires strict government control to maintain order, not personal autonomy.", "D": "By suggesting that individual autonomy and the right to pursue personal interests are essential for freedom, not alignment with a collective will.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Mill emphasizes individual autonomy as the core of true freedom, opposing Rousseau\u2019s view that freedom is achieved through alignment with a collective \u201cgeneral will.\u201dChoice A is incorrect; Mill values personal autonomy over collective alignment.Choice C is incorrect; Mill does not believe freedom requires conforming to societal standards.Choice D is incorrect; Mill does not support strict government control as a means of achieving freedom."}
