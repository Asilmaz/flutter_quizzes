{"introduction": "", "text": "Ecologist E.O. Wilson argues that preserving biodiversity is essential for ecosystem health, as each species contributes uniquely to environmental balance and resilience.", "text2": "Conservation biologist Chris Thomas acknowledges biodiversity\u2019s importance but suggests that some species naturally decline over time, indicating that not all losses are detrimental.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Thomas (Text 2) likely respond to Wilson\u2019s (Text 1) perspective on biodiversity? Provide reasoning for your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that all species must be preserved equally.", "B": "By arguing that some species losses do not harm ecosystems overall.", "C": "By suggesting that biodiversity is irrelevant to ecosystem health.", "D": "By asserting that ecosystem health relies on a few dominant species.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Thomas suggests that not every species loss is harmful, adding nuance to Wilson\u2019s emphasis on preserving biodiversity.Choice A is incorrect; Thomas does not argue for equal preservation of all species.Choice C is incorrect; Thomas acknowledges biodiversity\u2019s importance.Choice D is incorrect; neither author focuses solely on dominant species."}
