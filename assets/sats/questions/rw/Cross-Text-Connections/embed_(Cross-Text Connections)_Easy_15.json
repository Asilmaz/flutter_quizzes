	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Observing Antarctic soil samples led researchers to conclude that an extremely cold and dry climate could render the environment hostile to even the hardiest microbial life, implying that such conditions severely limit microbial survival.",
	"text2": "Text 2: A contrary viewpoint argues that microbes are found nearly everywhere on Earth, including extremely harsh habitats. If current methods fail to detect them, it may simply be because their numbers are too low or the technology insufficiently sensitive.",
	"question": "How would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the findings in Text 1 about the apparent absence of microbes in Antarctic soil?",
	"A": "They would concur that no life exists there and that no further exploration is needed.",
	"B": "They would propose that microbes may still be present in low quantities, rendering them undetectable by current tests.",
	"C": "They would suggest soil microbes do not depend on climate conditions for survival.",
	"D": "They would note that typical soil in more temperate climates has similarly low microbe counts.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 2 proposes that microbes are ubiquitous, even if they go undetected by available methods. The other choices are not supported by Text 2â€™s argument."
