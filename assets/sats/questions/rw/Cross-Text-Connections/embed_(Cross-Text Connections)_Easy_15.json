Montgomery recognizes the benefits of dense neighborhoods but would add that they can also cause challenges such as noise and overcrowding.Choice A is incorrect; Montgomery acknowledges both positive and negative impacts.Choice C is incorrect; Montgomery does not dismiss walkability\u2019s influence.Choice D is incorrect; Montgomery does not promote low-density areas over high-density ones."}
