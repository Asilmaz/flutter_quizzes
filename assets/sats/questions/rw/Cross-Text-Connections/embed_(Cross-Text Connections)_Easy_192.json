{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Aristotle, in Nicomachean Ethics, argued that the ultimate goal of human life is eudaimonia, often translated as happiness or flourishing. Aristotle believed that this could be achieved by living virtuously, which involves cultivating good character traits and finding a balance between extremes, or the \u201cGolden Mean,\u201d in one\u2019s actions and decisions.", "text2": "Philosopher Epicurus, in his writings on ethics, emphasized that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain are the keys to a good life. However, Epicurus clarified that not all pleasures should be pursued; true happiness comes from simple pleasures, intellectual pursuits, and the absence of physical or mental distress, rather than indulgence in excessive desires.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Epicurus (Text 2) likely respond to Aristotle\u2019s (Text 1) idea that living virtuously through the \u201cGolden Mean\u201d is essential for achieving a flourishing life? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that living virtuously and finding a balance in life is the only path to achieving happiness and flourishing.", "B": "By asserting that happiness can only be achieved through extreme indulgence, rejecting both balance and simplicity.", "C": "By arguing that flourishing is irrelevant, as life\u2019s only purpose is the continuous pursuit of extravagant pleasures.", "D": "By suggesting that while balance is important, true happiness lies in avoiding unnecessary desires and focusing on simple pleasures, which may not always align with Aristotle\u2019s emphasis on virtue.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Epicurus values simplicity and the avoidance of unnecessary desires, which complements but does not fully align with Aristotle\u2019s focus on achieving happiness through virtuous living and balance.Choice A is incorrect; while Epicurus values certain forms of balance, he does not prioritize the cultivation of virtues in the same way as Aristotle.Choice C is incorrect; Epicurus advocates against excessive indulgence, favoring simplicity and moderation.Choice D is incorrect; Epicurus would not dismiss the importance of flourishing, though his view of happiness emphasizes avoiding distress over extravagant pursuits."}
