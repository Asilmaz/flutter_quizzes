{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Karl Marx, in The Communist Manifesto, argued that history is defined by class struggle and that the capitalist system inevitably leads to exploitation of the working class. Marx advocated for a classless society where the means of production are collectively owned, leading to a more equitable distribution of resources and an end to the oppressive power of the bourgeoisie.", "text2": "Philosopher Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations, proposed that individual self-interest and competition in a free market ultimately benefit society as a whole. Smith believed that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market leads to efficient resource allocation, as individuals pursuing their own economic interests inadvertently contribute to the greater good of society.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Marx (Text 1) likely respond to Smith\u2019s (Text 2) idea that a free market benefits society through individuals pursuing self-interest? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that the pursuit of self-interest in a capitalist market inherently leads to class inequality, exploitation, and a concentration of wealth among the bourgeoisie, ultimately harming the working class.", "B": "By suggesting that capitalism should operate without any regulation, as it will naturally achieve a balance beneficial to all classes.", "C": "By asserting that markets are irrelevant to societal welfare, as only government control can ensure fair distribution of resources.", "D": "By agreeing that individual self-interest in a free market promotes social welfare and economic balance.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Marx would argue that the pursuit of self-interest in a capitalist market leads to inequality, exploitation, and a concentration of wealth among the bourgeoisie, which harms the working class and prevents equitable distribution of resources.Choice A is incorrect; Marx does not believe that individual self-interest in a free market promotes social welfare, as he sees capitalism as inherently exploitative.Choice C is incorrect; while Marx advocates for collective ownership, he does not dismiss the impact of markets entirely but critiques the capitalist framework.Choice D is incorrect; Marx would not advocate for unregulated capitalism, as he sees regulation insufficient to address capitalism\u2019s fundamental inequalities."}
