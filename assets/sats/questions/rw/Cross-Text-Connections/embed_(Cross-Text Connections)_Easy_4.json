{"introduction": "", "text": "Marine biologist Sylvia Earle has observed that sea otters play a crucial role in maintaining kelp forest ecosystems. By preying on sea urchins, which consume kelp, otters help ensure the health and growth of these underwater forests.", "text2": "Ecologist James Estes found that otters contribute to kelp forest stability but noted that other factors, like water temperature and pollution, also significantly impact kelp growth. Estes cautions that relying solely on otters for ecosystem health may overlook these additional influences.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Estes (Text 2) most likely respond to Earle\u2019s (Text 1) conclusion about sea otters?", "A": "By noting that otters help, but other environmental factors are also crucial.", "B": "By emphasizing that kelp forests are stable regardless of otter presence.", "C": "By agreeing that otters are the primary factor in kelp forest health.", "D": "By arguing that otters contribute little to kelp forest stability compared to other species.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "C is the best answer. Estes (Text 2) acknowledges otters\u2019 role but emphasizes that other factors also impact kelp health, indicating that otters alone are not sufficient for ecosystem stability.Choice A is incorrect; Estes does not suggest otters are the primary factor.Choice B is incorrect; Estes does not imply kelp forests thrive without otters.Choice D is incorrect; Estes values otters\u2019 role but also highlights other factors."}
