	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Soy sauce, created through fermentation, is known for its strong umami flavor. Scientists discovered that umami receptors were identified relatively recently, leading to a focus on how compounds in foods like seaweed and mushrooms produce this savory taste.",
	"text2": "Text 2: A study on soy sauce’s chemical structure revealed that low molecular weight compounds alone cannot replicate its full taste. Researchers found that certain proteins, particularly dipeptides, enhance not only the umami flavor but also add saltiness to the sauce.",
	"question": "How would the scientists in Text 2 most likely respond to the explanation in Text 1 about the source of umami flavor in soy sauce?",
	"A": "They would argue that fermentation-related proteins play a crucial role in developing a complex flavor that extends beyond simple umami compounds.",
	"B": "They would claim that mushroom-derived components are entirely responsible for the sauce’s flavor.",
	"C": "They would say that soy sauce cannot have umami flavor because it has a low salt content.",
	"D": "They would insist that natural fermentation eliminates all dipeptides, making the sauce less flavorful.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because Text 2 highlights the importance of proteins (dipeptides) in enhancing both umami and saltiness, indicating that fermentation alone does not explain the sauce’s flavor. The other choices contradict the findings in Text 2."
