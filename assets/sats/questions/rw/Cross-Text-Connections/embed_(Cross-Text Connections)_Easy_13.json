	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: A wave of pastoralism is credited with having turned fertile savannas into arid desert, as herds consumed critical vegetation, beginning an irreversible feedback loop of desertification.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Meteorological records and geologic data show that a shift in Earthâ€™s orbit caused a gradual drying trend, which pastoralist practices may have simply accelerated, delayed, or had no net effect on, depending on localized conditions.",
	"question": "If the researchers from Text 2 were to address the stance in Text 1, how would they likely respond?",
	"A": "They would describe the desertification process as unrelated to any climate shifts or human activity.",
	"B": "They would label any human involvement as purely beneficial in every environment worldwide.",
	"C": "They would acknowledge possible human influence but stress that broader orbital factors could supersede or complicate local pastoralist effects.",
	"D": "They would insist that newly introduced livestock triggered glacial conditions rather than desertification.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because Text 2 emphasizes large-scale climate drivers (orbital changes) that might overshadow or modify the impact humans had. The others are inconsistent with or contradict the data in Text 2."
