	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Certain ecologists claim that plankton diversity can remain high only when the environment experiences frequent disturbances, preventing any single species from dominating.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Another school of thought posits that the minuscule size and sparse distribution of plankton effectively reduce competition, suggesting that disturbances are not strictly necessary to explain high diversity in stable conditions.",
	"question": "How would adherents of Text 2 most likely respond to the reasoning presented in Text 1?",
	"A": "They would argue that frequent disturbances are irrelevant if direct competition is already minimal.",
	"B": "They would agree wholeheartedly that disturbances are the only way to sustain diversity.",
	"C": "They would propose halting all experiments dealing with ecological disturbances.",
	"D": "They would claim that plankton diversity is a myth created by incomplete sampling methods.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because Text 2 focuses on the physically constrained competition at the microscopic level, reducing the necessity of disturbances. The other answers either conflict with or misrepresent the stance in Text 2."
