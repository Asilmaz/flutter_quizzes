{"introduction": "", "text": "Marine biologist Sylvia Earle argues that ocean ecosystems rely on diverse species, like sharks, to maintain balance and prevent overpopulation of certain prey species.", "text2": "Ecologist Daniel Pauly agrees that biodiversity is crucial but notes that factors like pollution and climate change also play significant roles in ecosystem health.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Pauly (Text 2) likely respond to Earle\u2019s (Text 1) perspective on biodiversity? Provide reasoning for your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that sharks are the only essential species for ecosystem balance.", "B": "By asserting that ocean ecosystems are unaffected by climate change.", "C": "By suggesting that biodiversity alone cannot ensure ecosystem health.", "D": "By claiming that biodiversity is irrelevant to ecosystem balance.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Pauly believes that while biodiversity is important, other factors like pollution and climate change also affect ecosystem health, adding complexity to Earle\u2019s emphasis on biodiversity.Choice A is incorrect; Pauly does not single out sharks.Choice C is incorrect; Pauly acknowledges climate change\u2019s impact.Choice D is incorrect; both authors recognize biodiversity\u2019s importance."}
