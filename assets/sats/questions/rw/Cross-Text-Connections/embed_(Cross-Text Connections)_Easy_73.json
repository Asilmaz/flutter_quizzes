{"introduction": "", "text": "Astronomer Edwin Hubble demonstrated that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth, supporting the theory that the universe is expanding and challenging earlier assumptions of a static cosmos.", "text2": "Physicist Fred Hoyle, however, opposed the expanding universe theory, proposing a \u201csteady state\u201d model in which the universe remains constant and continuously creates new matter as it expands.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hoyle (Text 2) likely respond to Hubble\u2019s (Text 1) conclusions about the universe? Provide reasoning for your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that the universe is static without expansion.", "B": "By asserting that the universe remains constant while still generating matter.", "C": "By claiming that the universe\u2019s expansion is entirely unsupported.", "D": "By suggesting that cosmic expansion is unrelated to new matter creation.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hoyle believes in a steady-state universe that remains constant but continuously creates new matter, contrasting with Hubble\u2019s view of a simple expanding universe.Choice A is incorrect; Hoyle acknowledges expansion with constant new matter.Choice C is incorrect; Hoyle\u2019s steady-state model involves expansion.Choice D is incorrect; Hoyle connects expansion to new matter creation."}
