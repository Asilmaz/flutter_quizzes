{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, argued that in a \u201cstate of nature,\u201d individuals\u2019 lives would be filled with fear and conflict without a strong, absolute authority to maintain peace. Hobbes believed that individuals must surrender certain freedoms to a sovereign power to ensure societal stability and prevent the chaos that would arise from unrestricted freedom.", "text2": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in The Social Contract, claimed that true freedom is achieved through participation in a collective \u201cgeneral will,\u201d which represents the common good. Rousseau argued that individuals should work toward the welfare of the community, as personal freedom is best realized when individuals contribute to and are guided by the general will.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rousseau (Text 2) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 1) argument that individuals must surrender freedoms to a sovereign to avoid chaos? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that individuals achieve true freedom when they submit to the collective general will, rather than to an absolute sovereign, as this promotes mutual respect and societal harmony.", "B": "By agreeing that only a sovereign authority can create stability and that the general will should be replaced by absolute power.", "C": "By asserting that individuals should have no role in society\u2019s governance, as only strong central control ensures societal peace.", "D": "By arguing that personal freedoms are irrelevant, as societal harmony is best maintained by limiting individual rights to a minimum.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rousseau would likely argue that true freedom is achieved not by submitting to a sovereign authority, but by participating in the collective general will, as this supports mutual respect and societal harmony.Choice A is incorrect; Rousseau would not agree with replacing the general will with absolute sovereign power.Choice C is incorrect; Rousseau advocates for the role of individuals in forming the general will rather than denying them a role in governance.Choice D is incorrect; Rousseau emphasizes the significance of personal freedom in alignment with the common good, rather than dismissing individual rights."}
