{"introduction": "", "text": "In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith argued that individuals pursuing their own economic self-interest unintentionally promote the public good through the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market. He emphasized the importance of free markets and minimal government interference in fostering economic prosperity.", "text2": "In Das Kapital, Karl Marx critiqued capitalism, arguing that it inherently leads to inequality and exploitation of the working class. Marx believed that true societal progress required collective ownership of resources and the abolishment of private property, which he saw as the root cause of social disparities.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Marx (Text 2) likely respond to Smith\u2019s (Text 1) argument that the pursuit of self-interest benefits society through the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d is an illusion and that only government control can achieve true economic equality.", "B": "By agreeing that self-interest benefits society but arguing that government regulation is still necessary to ensure fairness.", "C": "By acknowledging that free markets can foster prosperity but emphasizing the need for collective ownership to prevent disparities.", "D": "By asserting that self-interest primarily leads to inequality and exploitation, rather than benefiting society as a whole.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Marx would likely argue that self-interest does not benefit society as Smith claims, but instead leads to exploitation and inequality, consistent with his critique of capitalism in Das Kapital.Choice A is incorrect; Marx does not believe that self-interest can benefit society under any circumstances, even with regulation.Choice C is incorrect; while Marx advocates for collective ownership, he does not acknowledge any inherent value in free markets.Choice D is incorrect; Marx critiques capitalism but does not argue for government control alone, focusing instead on abolishing private property and class structures."}
