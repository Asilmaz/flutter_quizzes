	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Stage performances in certain traditions incorporate long, sermon-like monologues that disrupt the formal boundaries between fiction and oral literature. Some scholars see these as traced to the influence of a single major playwright, who popularized their usage.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Others point out that sermon-like performances are abundant in works by various Black American authors, suggesting they represent a broader community tradition of challenging written/oral boundaries rather than being the hallmark of just one writerâ€™s influence.",
	"question": "Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the view in Text 1 that a single playwright introduced these sermon-like scenes?",
	"A": "They would call it too narrow, since many authors in the same cultural context have similarly tested the limits of literary form.",
	"B": "They would fully agree, emphasizing that all sermon-like elements in modern theater came from one playwright.",
	"C": "They would argue that such passages are typical only in historical religious ceremonies, not modern stage works.",
	"D": "They would reject the idea that sermon-like passages have any place in theatrical performance at all.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because Text 2 specifically states that this performance style is not isolated to one individual, but is part of a broader tradition. The other options conflict with that broader perspective."
