{"introduction": "", "text": "Environmental scientist Diana Beresford-Kroeger studied ancient forests and argued that mature trees contribute to ecosystems by sequestering carbon, thus playing a critical role in combating climate change.", "text2": "Forester Peter Wohlleben found that mature trees contribute to the ecosystem in multiple ways, but noted that factors like soil health and biodiversity also significantly impact carbon sequestration.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Wohlleben (Text 2) most likely respond to Beresford-Kroeger\u2019s (Text 1) conclusion?", "A": "By suggesting that younger trees sequester more carbon than mature ones.", "B": "By emphasizing that additional factors influence ecosystems beyond mature trees.", "C": "By claiming that mature trees play an insignificant role in carbon sequestration.", "D": "By arguing that soil health is the only factor in carbon sequestration.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Wohlleben (Text 2) acknowledges the importance of mature trees but would add that other factors like soil health also play a role in ecosystem health.Choice A is incorrect; Wohlleben does not minimize the role of mature trees.Choice C is incorrect; no comparison with younger trees is made.Choice D is incorrect; Wohlleben highlights multiple factors, not only soil health."}
