	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: One study claims that shipping lanes are effectively minimizing direct competition among shipping companies, as each route is controlled by a limited set of major carriers. This results in stable but uncompetitive pricing.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Another analysis shows that while certain primary routes may be dominated by a few players, many minor routes remain open to smaller companies. Over time, these smaller companies can expand and challenge established carriers, implying that competition is still viable if given enough time.",
	"question": "If the authors of Text 2 were to critique the study in Text 1, which viewpoint would they most likely express?",
	"A": "They would see no sign of any route being dominated by major carriers.",
	"B": "They would agree competition is locked out entirely across all global routes.",
	"C": "They would suggest that long-term market dynamics can shift, allowing emerging carriers to compete effectively.",
	"D": "They would argue that smaller companies inevitably collaborate with major carriers to fix prices.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because Text 2 notes that smaller carriers could grow on less-regulated routes, eventually becoming more competitive on major routes. The other options conflict with or oversimplify the second analysis."
