{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard argued that true self-discovery and fulfillment come from an individual\u2019s commitment to personal beliefs, often requiring a \u201cleap of faith.\u201d Kierkegaard believed that authenticity requires embracing uncertainty and acting independently of societal norms, allowing one to define their purpose through personal conviction rather than external validation.", "text2": "Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, however, emphasized the importance of free will and responsibility in shaping one\u2019s identity. In Sartre\u2019s existentialism, individuals create their essence through choices, but he argued that there is no pre-determined purpose or \u201cleap of faith\u201d to be made. Instead, Sartre believed that individuals must continuously define themselves through deliberate actions and take full responsibility for the consequences.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Sartre (Text 2) likely respond to Kierkegaard\u2019s (Text 1) concept of the \u201cleap of faith\u201d as essential to self-discovery? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that identity is fixed and not shaped by personal actions or beliefs.", "B": "By agreeing that a \u201cleap of faith\u201d is necessary for finding personal fulfillment.", "C": "By asserting that individuals have no need to make choices or consider responsibility in self-discovery.", "D": "By suggesting that while commitment to personal beliefs is important, identity is defined through continuous choices and responsibility, not a single leap of faith.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Sartre emphasizes that self-discovery comes from continuous choices and responsibility, rejecting Kierkegaard\u2019s idea of a singular \u201cleap of faith\u201d and instead advocating for identity as an ongoing process defined by actions.Choice A is incorrect; Sartre does not believe in a singular leap as essential for fulfillment.Choice C is incorrect; Sartre highly values the role of choice and responsibility in identity.Choice D is incorrect; Sartre believes identity is shaped by personal actions, not a fixed essence."}
