{"introduction": "", "text": "Environmental scientist Rachel Carson argued in Silent Spring that the widespread use of pesticides poses a serious threat to ecosystems and human health. Carson believed that chemicals such as DDT contaminate soil and water, harm wildlife, and accumulate in the food chain, leading to long-term ecological damage. She advocated for stricter regulation of chemical use to protect the environment and public health.", "text2": "Agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug, however, believed that pesticides and fertilizers are essential tools for modern agriculture. Borlaug argued that these chemicals play a critical role in increasing crop yields and feeding a growing global population. While he acknowledged potential risks, he emphasized that responsible use of pesticides can significantly reduce hunger and malnutrition, particularly in developing countries.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Borlaug (Text 2) likely respond to Carson\u2019s (Text 1) call for stricter regulation of pesticides? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that while environmental risks exist, the benefits of pesticides in improving food security and reducing hunger justify their careful, responsible use.", "B": "By asserting that pesticides have no environmental impact and therefore require no regulation.", "C": "By agreeing that strict regulation of pesticides is necessary to protect both human health and ecosystems.", "D": "By arguing that pesticides should be banned entirely, as their benefits do not outweigh their risks.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Borlaug acknowledges the potential environmental risks Carson raises but believes that the benefits of pesticides in enhancing food security are significant, supporting careful and responsible use rather than strict regulation.Choice A is incorrect; Borlaug does not believe strict regulation is necessary, favoring responsible use.Choice C is incorrect; Borlaug recognizes environmental impacts but argues for balanced, responsible use.Choice D is incorrect; Borlaug does not support a complete ban, viewing pesticides as essential to food production."}
