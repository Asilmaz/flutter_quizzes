{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jeremy Bentham, in An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, argued that the moral value of an action is determined by its utility\u2014its ability to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of actions, emphasizing that ethical decisions should maximize overall well-being.", "text2": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant, in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, argued that morality is based on adherence to universal principles and the categorical imperative. Kant believed that ethical actions stem from duty and respect for moral laws that can be universally applied, regardless of the outcomes. He rejected the idea that consequences determine moral value.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Kant (Text 2) likely respond to Bentham\u2019s (Text 1) idea that moral actions should prioritize maximizing happiness? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that the moral value of an action depends entirely on its consequences and the happiness it produces.", "B": "By suggesting that true morality is rooted in universal principles and duty, rather than being contingent on outcomes like happiness or well-being.", "C": "By asserting that morality is subjective and depends solely on individual preferences and cultural norms.", "D": "By arguing that maximizing personal happiness is the only reliable measure of ethical actions.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
