{"introduction": "", "text": "Poet Sylvia Plath\u2019s work often delves into themes of isolation, mental illness, and the struggle for identity, using vivid and sometimes unsettling imagery to capture these emotions. Critics have argued that her poetry offers a raw and intimate look into her personal battles, making her work resonate deeply with readers who face similar struggles.", "text2": "Literary critic Harold Bloom, while recognizing Plath\u2019s talent, suggested that her deeply personal focus can limit the universality of her work. Bloom argued that poetry achieves greater impact when it connects individual experience to broader, universal themes, rather than focusing heavily on personal anguish and isolation.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Bloom (Text 2) likely respond to the interpretation of Plath\u2019s (Text 1) poetry as powerful for its intimate portrayal of personal struggles? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that while personal experience is powerful, poetry should also connect to broader, universal themes for greater impact.", "B": "By asserting that personal experiences are irrelevant to poetic expression.", "C": "By agreeing that personal anguish and isolation are essential for poetry\u2019s universality.", "D": "By arguing that Plath\u2019s work lacks any relevance to readers due to its personal focus.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Bloom believes that while personal experience adds depth, poetry should also connect to universal themes to achieve a broader impact, contrasting with the view that Plath\u2019s intimate focus alone makes her work resonate.Choice A is incorrect; Bloom emphasizes the need for universality, not solely personal focus.Choice C is incorrect; Bloom values personal experience but suggests it should extend to universal themes.Choice D is incorrect; Bloom does not dismiss Plath\u2019s work but finds it limited in scope."}
