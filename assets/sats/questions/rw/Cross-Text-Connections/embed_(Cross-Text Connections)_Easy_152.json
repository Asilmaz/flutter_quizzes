{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard argued in Fear and Trembling that true self-discovery requires individuals to make a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d embracing personal beliefs even when they conflict with societal norms. Kierkegaard believed that authenticity and personal fulfillment come from acting in accordance with one\u2019s inner convictions, regardless of external pressures or rational explanations.", "text2": "Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, however, emphasized the importance of self-empowerment and individual will. In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche argued that individuals should strive to overcome societal expectations and define their own values. He rejected the idea of a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d believing instead that people should base their actions on reason and personal strength, not on adherence to beliefs without evidence.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Nietzsche (Text 2) likely respond to Kierkegaard\u2019s (Text 1) concept of the \u201cleap of faith\u201d for achieving self-discovery? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that self-discovery should be rooted in reason and personal empowerment, rather than in an irrational leap of faith.", "B": "By arguing that self-discovery requires strict adherence to external rules and rationality without personal input.", "C": "By asserting that societal norms alone should guide individuals\u2019 beliefs and actions.", "D": "By agreeing that a \u201cleap of faith\u201d is essential for personal fulfillment and authenticity.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Nietzsche emphasizes self-empowerment and reason as the basis for self-discovery, contrasting with Kierkegaard\u2019s focus on faith and personal conviction.Choice A is incorrect; Nietzsche does not support the concept of a \u201cleap of faith.\u201dChoice C is incorrect; Nietzsche advocates for individualism rather than societal conformity.Choice D is incorrect; Nietzsche values self-defined values over strict adherence to external rules."}
