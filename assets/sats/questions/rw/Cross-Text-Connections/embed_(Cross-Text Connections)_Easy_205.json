{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in The Social Contract, argued that true freedom is found when individuals participate in a collective \u201cgeneral will,\u201d which represents the common good. Rousseau believed that individuals must sometimes put aside personal interests to serve the welfare of the community, which, in turn, promotes true liberty through shared responsibility and mutual respect.", "text2": "Philosopher John Locke, in Two Treatises of Government, maintained that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property, which governments are obligated to protect. Locke believed that governmental power should be limited, serving to safeguard individual rights rather than enforcing collective ideals that could infringe on personal freedoms.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Locke (Text 2) likely respond to Rousseau\u2019s (Text 1) view that individuals should submit to the \u201cgeneral will\u201d to achieve true freedom? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that individual rights should be secondary to the community\u2019s collective goals, as this ensures a harmonious society.", "B": "By suggesting that all personal rights are irrelevant, as individuals are only truly free when completely controlled by a governing authority.", "C": "By arguing that while social harmony is valuable, government exists primarily to protect individual rights, and personal freedom should not be compromised for the sake of the general will.", "D": "By asserting that freedom and security are incompatible, and that only an absolute authority can maintain order without protecting individual rights.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Locke would likely argue that, although social harmony is valuable, the government\u2019s role is to protect individual rights, and personal freedoms should not be sacrificed to the collective general will.Choice A is incorrect; Locke does not support making individual rights secondary to the collective.Choice C is incorrect; Locke advocates for the protection of individual rights and does not view them as irrelevant.Choice D is incorrect; Locke does not believe that freedom and security are incompatible, nor does he support absolute authority over individual rights."}
