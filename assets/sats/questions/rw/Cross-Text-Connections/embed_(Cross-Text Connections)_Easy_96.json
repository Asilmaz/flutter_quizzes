{"introduction": "", "text": "Political theorist John Stuart Mill argued that free speech is essential to a functioning democracy, as it allows individuals to voice differing opinions and promotes intellectual diversity. Mill believed that even unpopular ideas should be allowed to circulate, as open debate helps reveal the truth and fosters personal growth and societal improvement.", "text2": "Legal scholar Alexander Meiklejohn, while supportive of free speech, emphasized that not all speech holds equal value in a democratic society. He argued that speech directly contributing to democratic decision-making deserves greater protection, whereas speech lacking relevance to public discourse might not require the same level of protection.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Meiklejohn (Text 2) likely respond to Mill\u2019s (Text 1) belief that all ideas should circulate freely? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that all speech, regardless of content, is essential to democracy.", "B": "By asserting that only popular opinions need to be protected in a democracy.", "C": "By suggesting that speech contributing directly to democratic processes should be prioritized.", "D": "By claiming that free speech has no place in democratic societies.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Meiklejohn agrees on the importance of free speech but prioritizes speech that actively supports democratic functions, adding nuance to Mill\u2019s broader support for unrestricted idea circulation.Choice A is incorrect; Meiklejohn distinguishes between types of speech.Choice C is incorrect; neither Mill nor Meiklejohn suggests only popular views need protection.Choice D is incorrect; Meiklejohn believes free speech is vital, though with a specific focus on democratic relevance."}
