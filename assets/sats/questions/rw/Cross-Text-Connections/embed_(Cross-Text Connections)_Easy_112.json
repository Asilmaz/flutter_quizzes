{"introduction": "", "text": "Art critic John Berger admired Pablo Picasso\u2019s use of abstraction, believing that Picasso\u2019s distortion of forms allowed viewers to see deeper, universal truths about human nature and society. Berger argued that Picasso\u2019s abstract style challenged conventional beauty standards and invited viewers to question their assumptions about reality and art.", "text2": "Art historian Meyer Schapiro acknowledged Picasso\u2019s skill but suggested that his use of abstraction sometimes obscures meaning, making his work less accessible to the public. Schapiro argued that while Picasso\u2019s style was innovative, it could also create a distance between the artwork and viewers, limiting their ability to connect emotionally with the subject.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Schapiro (Text 2) likely respond to Berger\u2019s (Text 1) praise of Picasso\u2019s use of abstraction? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that Picasso\u2019s abstract style limits his ability to depict human emotion altogether.", "B": "By agreeing that Picasso\u2019s abstract style fully reveals universal truths about human nature.", "C": "By suggesting that Picasso\u2019s abstraction can sometimes make his art feel distant and less emotionally accessible.", "D": "By claiming that Picasso\u2019s art is entirely conventional and lacks innovation.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Schapiro believes that Picasso\u2019s abstraction can create emotional distance, contrasting with Berger\u2019s view that it reveals universal truths.Choice A is incorrect; Schapiro sees abstraction as sometimes limiting emotional connection.Choice C is incorrect; Schapiro acknowledges Picasso\u2019s innovation in art.Choice D is incorrect; Schapiro does not argue that Picasso\u2019s style completely limits emotional expression, only that it may create some distance."}
