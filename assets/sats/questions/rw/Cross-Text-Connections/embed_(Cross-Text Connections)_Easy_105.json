{"introduction": "", "text": "Conservationist Aldo Leopold argued in A Sand County Almanac that humans have an ethical responsibility to preserve wilderness, viewing it as an integral part of the land\u2019s ecological health. Leopold believed that protecting natural landscapes promotes biodiversity, fosters resilience, and upholds an ethical duty to respect the land and its ecosystems.", "text2": "Environmental economist William Baxter acknowledged the importance of conservation but argued that natural resources should primarily serve human needs. Baxter suggested that environmental policies should prioritize human welfare and economic growth, as resources are most valuable when they provide direct benefits to society, even if it means some areas are modified for development.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Baxter (Text 2) likely respond to Leopold\u2019s (Text 1) perspective on wilderness preservation? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that wilderness should be preserved solely for its ecological benefits.", "B": "By claiming that wilderness has no value and should not be preserved.", "C": "By suggesting that conservation should balance ecological preservation with human-centered economic priorities.", "D": "By arguing that environmental policies should disregard economic considerations.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Baxter believes that while conservation is important, it should be balanced with economic growth and human welfare, reflecting a more utilitarian approach than Leopold\u2019s purely ecological emphasis.Choice A is incorrect; Baxter values both conservation and human benefit.Choice C is incorrect; Baxter acknowledges wilderness value but in a human-centered context.Choice D is incorrect; Baxter supports the integration of economic considerations in environmental policies."}
