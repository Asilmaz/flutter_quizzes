{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard argued that true fulfillment comes from an individual\u2019s commitment to personal beliefs and values, even in the face of societal opposition. Kierkegaard believed that only through a \u201cleap of faith\u201d can one achieve authentic selfhood, as genuine commitment requires one to embrace uncertainty and act independently of societal norms.", "text2": "Psychologist Abraham Maslow, however, emphasized that fulfillment, or self-actualization, arises when individuals reach their full potential through positive personal growth, such as creativity, problem-solving, and moral development. Maslow believed that self-actualization was a progression through a hierarchy of needs, rather than a leap into the unknown.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Maslow (Text 2) likely respond to Kierkegaard\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on the \u201cleap of faith\u201d as essential to fulfillment? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that self-actualization is unrelated to any personal growth or development.", "B": "By arguing that fulfillment can only be achieved by rejecting all societal norms entirely.", "C": "By suggesting that self-actualization occurs through gradual development of one\u2019s potential, rather than taking a leap into the unknown.", "D": "By agreeing that fulfillment comes from embracing uncertainty and acting against societal norms.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Maslow emphasizes self-actualization as a gradual, positive growth through a hierarchy of needs, in contrast to Kierkegaard\u2019s idea of a sudden \u201cleap of faith\u201d into the unknown for fulfillment.Choice A is incorrect; Maslow does not focus on uncertainty or acting against norms.Choice C is incorrect; Maslow\u2019s concept of self-actualization is closely related to personal growth.Choice D is incorrect; Maslow does not advocate rejecting all societal norms for fulfillment."}
