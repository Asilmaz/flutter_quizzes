{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, in On Liberty, argued that individual freedom is essential for personal development and societal progress. Mill advocated for a \u201charm principle,\u201d suggesting that individuals should be free to act as they wish, provided they do not harm others. He believed that the freedom of thought and expression is crucial for a vibrant and evolving society.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, contended that without a strong authority to impose order, individuals would live in a state of constant fear and conflict. Hobbes argued that individuals must sacrifice certain freedoms to ensure peace and security under an absolute sovereign, as unrestricted freedom would lead to chaos.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 1) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 2) view that individual freedom should be restricted for the sake of peace and security? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that while security is important, individuals should be free to act as they choose as long as they do not harm others, as this fosters both personal growth and societal progress.", "B": "By agreeing that all individual freedoms should be sacrificed in favor of an absolute authority to maintain peace and prevent chaos.", "C": "By suggesting that any form of freedom is irrelevant and that the imposition of order through absolute control is the only path to a stable society.", "D": "By asserting that freedom of thought and action are secondary to economic prosperity and should be limited to maximize wealth.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
