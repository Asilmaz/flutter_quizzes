	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Volcano-induced climate change is sometimes cited as the principal factor behind certain mass extinctions, including the one at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, due to massive eruptions releasing large volumes of greenhouse gases.",
	"text2": "Text 2: A study focusing on ocean core samples indicated that while volcanic gases may indeed have temporarily altered climate conditions, the timing of the major extinction event aligns more closely with a significant asteroid impact, suggesting the volcanic effect had largely subsided before the mass die-off.",
	"question": "Based on the texts, how would the study described in Text 2 most likely respond to the claim that volcanic activity alone caused the K-Pg extinction?",
	"A": "It would agree that eruptions are solely responsible but suggests further study on asteroid impacts.",
	"B": "It would reject that idea, pointing out that the critical extinction period coincides more precisely with the asteroid impact.",
	"C": "It would claim that ocean core samples are unreliable and do not shed light on volcanic gas emissions.",
	"D": "It would attribute the K-Pg event entirely to greenhouse gases persisting long after volcanic eruptions ended.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 2 emphasizes how the extinction event lines up with an asteroid impact rather than sustained volcanic influence. The other options run counter to the studyâ€™s core conclusion."
