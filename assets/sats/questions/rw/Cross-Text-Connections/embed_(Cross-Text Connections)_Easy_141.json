{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued in Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals that morality is grounded in duty and universal principles, rather than emotions or consequences. Kant believed that moral actions must be performed out of a sense of duty, guided by what he called the \u201ccategorical imperative,\u201d which requires individuals to act according to principles they would want universally applied.", "text2": "Philosopher David Hume, however, contended that morality is rooted in human emotions and sympathy. Hume argued that people make moral judgments based on feelings of empathy and connection to others, rather than abstract rules. He believed that moral values are derived from the natural human tendency to feel sympathy toward others, making them subjective rather than universally fixed.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hume (Text 2) likely respond to Kant\u2019s (Text 1) claim that morality should be based on universal duty rather than emotions? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that morality should be based solely on logical principles, without considering human emotions or duty.", "B": "By suggesting that morality is better understood through human emotions and sympathy, as these provide a natural basis for moral judgments.", "C": "By asserting that morality has no connection to either duty or emotions.", "D": "By agreeing that duty and universal principles should be the sole basis for moral judgments.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hume argued that morality stems from human emotions and sympathy, opposing Kant\u2019s view that morality should be guided by universal principles and duty.Choice A is incorrect; Hume does not believe in universal duty as the foundation of morality.Choice C is incorrect; Hume links morality closely to emotions, particularly sympathy.Choice D is incorrect; Hume does not argue for morality based solely on logic, but rather on natural human emotions."}
