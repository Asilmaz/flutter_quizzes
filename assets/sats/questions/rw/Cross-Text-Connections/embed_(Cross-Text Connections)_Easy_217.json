{"introduction": "", "text": "In Meditations on First Philosophy, Ren\u00e9 Descartes argued that doubt is a necessary foundation for achieving certainty. By doubting everything that could be questioned, Descartes concluded that the only undeniable truth is one\u2019s existence, encapsulated in the phrase \u201cCogito, ergo sum\u201d (I think, therefore I am). He maintained that reason and systematic doubt lead to true knowledge.", "text2": "In The Advancement of Learning, Francis Bacon emphasized the role of empirical observation in gaining knowledge. Bacon argued that relying solely on abstract reasoning without testing ideas against the natural world leads to incomplete understanding. He advocated for inductive reasoning, where observations and experiments form the basis for general conclusions.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Bacon (Text 2) likely respond to Descartes\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on doubt as the path to certainty? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that doubt is essential for certainty, but only when combined with rigorous experimentation and observation.", "B": "By arguing that empirical observation, rather than doubt, is the most reliable method for acquiring true knowledge.", "C": "By asserting that systematic doubt undermines the ability to trust one\u2019s senses, making empirical study ineffective.", "D": "By suggesting that abstract reasoning and empirical observation are equally important paths to knowledge.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Bacon would likely argue that empirical observation, not doubt, is the most reliable path to knowledge, as his philosophy centers on testing ideas against the natural world rather than abstract reasoning alone.Choice A is incorrect; while Bacon values experimentation, he does not emphasize doubt as part of his method.Choice C is incorrect; Bacon would not dismiss the value of sensory trust, as it forms the foundation of his empirical method.Choice D is incorrect; although it appears balanced, Bacon prioritizes empirical observation over abstract reasoning."}
