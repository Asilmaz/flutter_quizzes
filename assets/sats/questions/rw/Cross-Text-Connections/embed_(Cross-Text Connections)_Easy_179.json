{"introduction": "", "text": "Political theorist Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli argued in The Prince that effective rulers should focus on practicality and outcomes rather than moral considerations. Machiavelli believed that maintaining power often requires actions that may be viewed as morally questionable, and that a successful leader must be willing to use deception, manipulation, or even cruelty if it ensures stability and control.", "text2": "Philosopher John Locke, in Two Treatises of Government, argued that legitimate government is rooted in the consent of the governed and the protection of natural rights. Locke believed that rulers must prioritize the welfare and rights of their citizens, and that any government violating these principles loses its legitimacy. For Locke, the preservation of individual rights is essential to a just and effective government.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Locke (Text 2) likely respond to Machiavelli\u2019s (Text 1) view that rulers should prioritize power and control over moral considerations? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that rulers must focus solely on maintaining power, even at the expense of morality.", "B": "By arguing that rulers should ignore citizens' welfare to ensure long-term control and power stability.", "C": "By suggesting that a just government should respect and protect the natural rights of individuals, and that rulers who prioritize control over rights lack legitimate authority.", "D": "By asserting that morality has no place in government and that any means necessary should be used to retain power.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Locke believes that a government\u2019s legitimacy comes from respecting individual rights, directly opposing Machiavelli\u2019s view that rulers should prioritize power over moral considerations.Choice A is incorrect; Locke does not support the idea that power should be prioritized over moral responsibility.Choice C is incorrect; Locke values morality and the protection of rights in governance.Choice D is incorrect; Locke argues that a ruler\u2019s duty is to uphold the welfare of citizens, not disregard it for power."}
