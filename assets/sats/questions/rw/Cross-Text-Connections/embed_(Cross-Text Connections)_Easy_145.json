{"introduction": "", "text": "Economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that economic inequality undermines social cohesion and limits economic growth. In The Price of Inequality, Stiglitz suggested that high levels of inequality create barriers to social mobility, reduce overall demand, and increase instability, ultimately harming long-term economic progress and societal well-being.", "text2": "Economist Milton Friedman, however, contended that inequality is a natural outcome of a free-market economy and provides incentives for innovation and productivity. Friedman argued that economic growth depends on rewarding individual achievement and that attempts to reduce inequality through government intervention can hinder market efficiency and slow progress.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Friedman (Text 2) likely respond to Stiglitz\u2019s (Text 1) view that inequality harms economic stability? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that inequality undermines economic stability and must be reduced.", "B": "By arguing that economic stability is best achieved by imposing strict limits on individual wealth.", "C": "By suggesting that inequality fosters innovation and growth by rewarding individual achievement, making it essential to a thriving economy.", "D": "By asserting that inequality has no impact on either social cohesion or economic stability.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Friedman believed that inequality creates incentives for productivity and innovation, contributing to economic growth, which contrasts with Stiglitz\u2019s view that inequality undermines stability.Choice A is incorrect; Friedman does not see reducing inequality as necessary for stability.Choice C is incorrect; Friedman acknowledges inequality\u2019s impact but considers it positive for growth.Choice D is incorrect; Friedman supports free-market principles and does not advocate for strict limits on wealth."}
