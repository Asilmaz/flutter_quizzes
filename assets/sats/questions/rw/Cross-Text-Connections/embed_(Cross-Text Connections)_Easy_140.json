{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill argued in On Liberty that personal freedom is essential for individual and societal progress. Mill believed that individuals should be free to express their beliefs and make choices without interference, as long as their actions do not harm others. He argued that this freedom fosters creativity and allows people to pursue happiness in ways that best suit them.", "text2": "Political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, however, argued in Leviathan that individuals\u2019 freedoms must be limited to maintain social order. Hobbes believed that in a state of nature, people act out of self-interest, which can lead to conflict and instability. Therefore, he asserted that a strong central authority is necessary to prevent chaos, even if it requires restricting some personal freedoms.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Mill\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on personal freedom as essential for progress? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that freedom has no impact on individual or societal progress.", "B": "By agreeing that unrestricted personal freedom leads to the best outcomes for society.", "C": "By suggesting that while freedom is valuable, it should be limited by a strong central authority to prevent societal conflict and maintain stability.", "D": "By arguing that society should eliminate all central authority to maximize personal freedom.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hobbes believed that unrestricted personal freedom could lead to chaos and argued for the importance of a strong central authority to maintain social stability, contrasting with Mill\u2019s emphasis on personal liberty.Choice A is incorrect; Hobbes does not believe unrestricted freedom benefits society.Choice C is incorrect; Hobbes acknowledges freedom\u2019s impact but sees it as needing control.Choice D is incorrect; Hobbes supports centralized authority rather than its elimination."}
