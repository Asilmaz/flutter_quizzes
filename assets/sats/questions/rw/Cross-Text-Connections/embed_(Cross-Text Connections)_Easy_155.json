{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill argued in On Liberty that individual freedom is essential for personal development and societal progress. Mill believed that people should have the liberty to express their thoughts and make personal choices, as long as their actions do not harm others. According to Mill, freedom allows individuals to explore diverse ideas, leading to innovation and growth.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, however, argued in Leviathan that individual freedom must be restricted to maintain social order and prevent conflict. Hobbes believed that without a strong central authority to enforce rules, people would act solely in self-interest, leading to chaos. In his view, individuals should surrender some freedoms to the government to ensure peace and stability.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Mill\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on individual freedom as essential for personal and societal development?
