{"introduction": "", "text": "Political philosopher John Locke argued in Two Treatises of Government that government exists primarily to protect individuals\u2019 natural rights to life, liberty, and property. Locke believed that a legitimate government derives its authority from the consent of the governed and must safeguard these rights. If a government fails in this duty, he argued, citizens have the right to overthrow it.", "text2": "Political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, however, argued in Leviathan that a strong, centralized authority is necessary to maintain order and prevent conflict. Hobbes believed that without such authority, life would be chaotic, with individuals acting in their own self-interest, leading to a \u201cstate of nature\u201d filled with violence. Therefore, he argued that people should submit to a sovereign power to ensure stability and peace, even if it limits some freedoms.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Locke\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that citizens have the right to overthrow a government that fails to protect their rights? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that a strong, centralized authority is essential to maintain order, and citizens should not have the right to overthrow it, as it would lead to instability.", "B": "By arguing that citizens should only have the right to overthrow a government in times of prosperity, not conflict.", "C": "By agreeing that the right to overthrow the government is fundamental to a peaceful society.", "D": "By asserting that citizens have no rights within the social contract and must obey the government unconditionally.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hobbes values a strong central authority to prevent chaos and would likely argue against giving citizens the right to overthrow the government, as he believes such actions would lead to disorder and instability, in contrast to Locke\u2019s emphasis on individual rights.Choice A is incorrect; Hobbes does not support the right to overthrow the government.Choice C is incorrect; while Hobbes emphasizes obedience, he does not deny all rights within the social contract.Choice D is incorrect; Hobbes does not condition citizens\u2019 rights based on prosperity but values stability over frequent government change."}
