{"introduction": "", "text": "Economist John Maynard Keynes argued in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money that government intervention is essential during economic downturns to stimulate demand and reduce unemployment. Keynes believed that increased public spending and investment are necessary to kickstart economic recovery, as relying solely on market forces could lead to prolonged recessions and widespread hardship.", "text2": "Economist Friedrich Hayek, however, maintained in The Road to Serfdom that government intervention disrupts natural market adjustments and creates inefficiencies. Hayek argued that allowing the free market to correct itself, even in economic downturns, leads to more sustainable growth in the long run. He believed that excessive government spending and regulation would ultimately stifle economic freedom and innovation.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hayek (Text 2) likely respond to Keynes\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that government spending is necessary to alleviate unemployment during economic downturns? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that government intervention is essential for economic recovery and job creation.", "B": "By suggesting that a free-market approach, without government interference, provides a more stable and sustainable path to recovery, as natural market adjustments prevent inefficiencies.", "C": "By arguing that government intervention should focus exclusively on controlling inflation, not on reducing unemployment.", "D": "By asserting that economic downturns are irrelevant to both government policy and market adjustments.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hayek believes that the free market should be allowed to adjust naturally, even in downturns, as he views government intervention as disruptive to economic efficiency, contrasting with Keynes\u2019s support for intervention to reduce unemployment.Choice A is incorrect; Hayek opposes government intervention in economic recovery.Choice C is incorrect; Hayek considers economic policies highly relevant, though he supports free-market adjustments.Choice D is incorrect; Hayek does not advocate government intervention focused solely on inflation but prefers minimal interference overall."}
