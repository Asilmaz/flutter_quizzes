{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Plato, in The Republic, argued that society functions best when individuals fulfill roles suited to their natural abilities. Plato believed in a hierarchical society led by philosopher-kings, as he thought that only those who truly understand justice and wisdom should govern, while others contribute according to their skills and talents.", "text2": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, in On Liberty, advocated for individual freedom and self-determination, suggesting that each person should have the right to pursue their own path as long as it does not harm others. Mill argued that individuals grow and develop best when they are allowed to make choices independently, without interference from an imposed social structure.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 2) likely respond to Plato\u2019s (Text 1) view that society should be structured hierarchically and governed by philosopher-kings? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that a hierarchical structure led by the wise is essential for a harmonious society and that individual freedom should be limited.", "B": "By arguing that individuals develop best when they are free to make their own choices, and that imposing a hierarchy limits personal growth and self-determination.", "C": "By suggesting that people lack the capacity for self-governance and require a structured social order to prevent societal chaos.", "D": "By asserting that only philosopher-kings have the wisdom to ensure both societal order and individual fulfillment, and thus should lead society.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Mill would argue that individual freedom and self-determination lead to personal growth, and that imposing a rigid hierarchy undermines individual development by restricting personal choice.Choice A is incorrect; Mill would not support limiting individual freedom or endorsing a hierarchical social structure.Choice C is incorrect; Mill advocates for personal autonomy and does not believe people require a strict structure for self-governance.Choice D is incorrect; Mill would not support the idea of philosopher-kings as sole leaders, as he values the individual\u2019s capacity to make independent choices."}
