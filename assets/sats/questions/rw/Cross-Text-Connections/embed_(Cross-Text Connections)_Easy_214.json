{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher David Hume, in A Treatise of Human Nature, argued that reason alone cannot determine moral values. Hume believed that human actions are driven by emotions and desires, not solely by rational thought. He famously stated, \u201cReason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions,\u201d emphasizing that moral judgments stem from feelings rather than pure logic.", "text2": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant, in Critique of Practical Reason, argued that morality is rooted in rational principles that apply universally, independent of personal desires. Kant proposed the concept of the \u201ccategorical imperative,\u201d which requires individuals to act only according to maxims that could be universally applied, emphasizing that rationality is the foundation of ethical action.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Kant (Text 2) likely respond to Hume\u2019s (Text 1) view that moral values stem from emotions rather than reason? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that reason has no role in ethical decisions, as emotions alone are sufficient to guide people to moral choices.", "B": "By agreeing that emotions play a significant role in moral decision-making, as they guide individuals toward ethical behavior.", "C": "By asserting that morality is subjective and that each person\u2019s feelings determine their moral values, rather than any universal rule.", "D": "By suggesting that true morality must be based on rational principles rather than emotions, as only reason provides a foundation for universal ethical standards.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Kant would likely argue that true morality must be grounded in rational principles, as he believed reason provides a foundation for universal ethical standards that are not influenced by individual emotions.Choice A is incorrect; Kant did not believe emotions should guide moral decisions, as he valued rationality over feeling in ethical matters.Choice C is incorrect; Kant did not view morality as subjective, but rather as objective and universal.Choice D is incorrect; Kant would disagree with the idea that emotions alone are sufficient for moral guidance, as he emphasized the importance of rationality."}
