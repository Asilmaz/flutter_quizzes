{"introduction": "", "text": "Physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity proposed that space and time are interconnected, forming a flexible \u201cfabric\u201d affected by gravity, which revolutionized our understanding of the universe.", "text2": "Physicist Isaac Newton\u2019s earlier work described gravity as a force acting at a distance between objects with mass, a simpler model that assumed space and time were absolute and unchanging.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Newton (Text 2) likely respond to Einstein\u2019s (Text 1) theory of relativity? Provide reasoning for your answer.", "A": "By arguing that space and time are absolute and unaffected by external forces.", "B": "By agreeing that space and time are flexible concepts affected by gravity.", "C": "By claiming that gravity is irrelevant to the structure of space-time.", "D": "By suggesting that relativity provides no new insights into gravity.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Newton\u2019s model assumed space and time were fixed and unaffected by gravity, contrasting with Einstein\u2019s idea of a flexible space-time fabric.Choice A is incorrect; Newton did not view space and time as flexible.Choice C is incorrect; Newton\u2019s theory focuses on gravity\u2019s effect, though as a force.Choice D is incorrect; relativity offers a new framework that Newton did not propose."}
