{"introduction": "", "text": "Literary critics frequently divide William Faulkner\u2019s works into phases, suggesting that his early novels focus on the breakdown of traditional Southern values, while his later works reflect a more universal exploration of human psychology and existential questions. Critics argue that this shift demonstrates Faulkner\u2019s growth as a writer, moving beyond regional issues to address broader themes.", "text2": "Biographer Joseph Blotner, however, maintains that Faulkner\u2019s core themes\u2014family loyalty, the passage of time, and the influence of the past\u2014remain consistent across his career. According to Blotner, Faulkner\u2019s later works do not abandon Southern themes but rather revisit them through a broader psychological and existential lens, showing continuity rather than a complete thematic shift.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Blotner (Text 2) likely respond to the critics\u2019 (Text 1) interpretation of Faulkner\u2019s thematic evolution? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that Faulkner\u2019s work is limited to exploring universal existential issues only, with no regional influences.", "B": "By suggesting that Faulkner\u2019s core themes remain consistent but are explored in new, broader contexts over time.", "C": "By asserting that Faulkner\u2019s early works lack any focus on Southern identity or psychological themes.", "D": "By agreeing that Faulkner\u2019s later works represent a total departure from his Southern themes.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Blotner believes Faulkner\u2019s thematic concerns are consistent across his career, although his later works approach these themes in a broader, more complex way without abandoning the Southern focus entirely.Choice A is incorrect; Blotner sees continuity in Faulkner\u2019s themes, not a total departure.Choice C is incorrect; Blotner acknowledges Southern and psychological themes from the start.Choice D is incorrect; Blotner emphasizes the ongoing presence of Southern themes in Faulkner\u2019s work."}
