{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, argued that humans are naturally self-interested and, in the absence of authority, live in a \u201cstate of nature\u201d characterized by conflict and chaos. To avoid this state, Hobbes believed individuals must surrender some freedoms to a central authority, or sovereign, in exchange for peace and security.", "text2": "Philosopher John Locke, in Two Treatises of Government, argued that humans are capable of living cooperatively and forming governments based on mutual consent. Unlike Hobbes, Locke believed that government exists to protect individuals\u2019 natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that it derives its legitimacy from the consent of the governed rather than absolute authority.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Locke (Text 2) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that individuals must surrender freedoms to a sovereign authority to maintain peace? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that while order is important, a government\u2019s legitimacy must derive from the consent of the governed and its ability to protect natural rights, rather than imposing authority through force.", "B": "By agreeing that surrendering all freedoms to a sovereign is necessary to avoid societal chaos and ensure order.", "C": "By asserting that no form of authority is necessary, as humans are naturally capable of living peacefully without any governing structure.", "D": "By arguing that individual rights are secondary to the authority of the sovereign and should always be relinquished for societal security.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Locke would argue that government exists to protect natural rights and must derive legitimacy from the people\u2019s consent, which contrasts with Hobbes\u2019s emphasis on a strong sovereign authority.Choice A is incorrect; Locke does not support absolute authority or the total surrender of freedoms.Choice C is incorrect; while Locke believes in cooperative human nature, he recognizes the need for a government to protect rights and maintain order.Choice D is incorrect; Locke prioritizes individual rights over the authority of a sovereign, emphasizing mutual consent."}
