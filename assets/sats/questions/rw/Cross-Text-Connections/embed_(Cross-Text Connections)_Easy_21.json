	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Certain scholars believe that the Deccan Traps eruption was responsible for the K-Pg extinction event. They reference other mass extinctions coinciding with large-scale volcanic eruptions as further evidence of this link.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Pincelli Hull and her colleagues contend that any greenhouse gas effects from the Deccan Traps had largely dissipated before the global die-off, which aligns instead with a massive impact at Chicxulub. Their core-sample analysis puts the eruption’s primary influence too early to be the main trigger of extinctions.",
	"question": "How would Hull and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the argument in Text 1 linking mass extinction solely to volcanic activity?",
	"A": "They would deem the timing of the volcanic influence insufficient, since their research indicates it ended before the critical extinction window.",
	"B": "They would endorse the position that large-scale eruptions always dominate other potential extinction triggers.",
	"C": "They would concede that volcanic eruptions peaked exactly at the same time as the mass extinction.",
	"D": "They would argue that ocean core-sample data has zero bearing on geological events.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because Text 2 explicitly states that climate impacts from the Deccan Traps occurred too early to drive the K-Pg event, thus disagreeing with the sole volcanic cause argument. The other choices are refuted by Text 2’s conclusions."
