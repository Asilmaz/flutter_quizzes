	"text": "Text 1: Philosopher G.E. Moore posits that everyday beliefs—like ‘I have two hands’—are self-evident truths, requiring no elaborate proof. He famously demonstrated this by holding up each hand and stating, ‘Here is one hand, and here is another.’",
	"text2": "Text 2: Many philosophers reject Moore’s approach, asserting that simply gesturing at the world does not address deep skepticism about the external universe. Yet they struggle to articulate precisely why such ‘common sense’ arguments fail to refute radical doubt.",
	"question": "How would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to Moore’s well-known ‘two hands’ demonstration discussed in Text 1?",
	"A": "By acknowledging it as a clever proof that definitively counters skepticism.",
	"B": "By contending it is a superficial approach that bypasses the core issues raised by external world skepticism.",
	"C": "By insisting Moore was unaware of the existence of radical skepticism in his era.",
	"D": "By praising its scientific rigor and reliance on empirical measurement tools.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 2 highlights that many philosophers find Moore’s simple gesture unsatisfactory. The other options do not reflect the critical stance described in Text 2."
