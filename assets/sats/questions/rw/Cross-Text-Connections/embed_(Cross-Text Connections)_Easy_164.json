{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued in Leviathan that in a state of nature, individuals are driven by self-interest, which leads to conflict and violence. Hobbes believed that to avoid chaos, individuals should submit to an absolute sovereign who maintains order and security, thus ensuring societal stability. For Hobbes, peace and security are more important than individual freedoms.", "text2": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, however, argued in The Social Contract that individuals can achieve true freedom by aligning with the \u201cgeneral will\u201d of society. Rousseau believed that people are naturally inclined towards cooperation and that a just society arises from a collective agreement that respects the freedom of all, rather than being controlled by a sovereign power.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rousseau (Text 2) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that an absolute sovereign is essential for maintaining societal stability? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that individual freedoms should be entirely surrendered to avoid conflict.", "B": "By agreeing that a sovereign is the best way to achieve order and protect individual rights.", "C": "By asserting that stability has no relation to government structure or individual freedoms.", "D": "By suggesting that societal stability can be achieved by a collective agreement in which people willingly align with the general will, rather than submitting to a single authority.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rousseau believes in the importance of a collective agreement, or \u201cgeneral will,\u201d to achieve stability and freedom, contrasting with Hobbes\u2019s view that an absolute sovereign is necessary for societal order.Choice A is incorrect; Rousseau does not support the idea of an absolute sovereign.Choice C is incorrect; Rousseau does believe that government structure is crucial to achieving stability and freedom.Choice D is incorrect; Rousseau values the preservation of individual freedoms rather than surrendering them entirely."}
