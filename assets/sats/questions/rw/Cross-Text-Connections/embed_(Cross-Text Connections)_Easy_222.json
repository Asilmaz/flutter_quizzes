{"introduction": "", "text": "In A Room of One\u2019s Own, Virginia Woolf explores the systemic barriers that have historically prevented women from achieving equality in literature and the arts. Woolf emphasizes the need for financial independence and private space as prerequisites for creative expression, arguing that societal constraints have silenced women\u2019s voices.", "text2": "In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir critiques the cultural and philosophical traditions that have defined women as \u201cthe Other.\u201d She asserts that gender inequality stems from constructed social roles, emphasizing that women must challenge these structures to attain true liberation and agency.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would de Beauvoir (Text 2) likely respond to Woolf\u2019s (Text 1) argument that financial independence and private space are essential for women\u2019s creative expression? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that Woolf\u2019s focus on financial independence overlooks the deeper societal structures that perpetuate women\u2019s subordination.", "B": "By agreeing that financial independence is important but emphasizing that liberation also requires dismantling cultural roles that define women as inferior.", "C": "By arguing that creative expression alone cannot lead to true equality and that women must instead focus on achieving broader societal transformation.", "D": "By suggesting that Woolf underestimates the role of collective activism in challenging systemic barriers to gender equality.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "A is the best answer. De Beauvoir would likely agree with Woolf that financial independence is necessary but would emphasize the importance of also dismantling cultural and social constructs that position women as \u201cthe Other.\u201dChoice B is incorrect; while de Beauvoir critiques societal structures, she does not dismiss the importance of financial independence or private space.Choice C is incorrect; de Beauvoir does not reject the value of creative expression but sees it as part of a larger fight for equality.Choice D is incorrect; while de Beauvoir acknowledges the role of collective activism, she would likely align with Woolf\u2019s emphasis on personal resources as a foundation for broader change."}
