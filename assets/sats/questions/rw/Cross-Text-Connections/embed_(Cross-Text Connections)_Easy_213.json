{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, in Being and Nothingness, argued that humans are \u201ccondemned to be free,\u201d meaning they are responsible for defining their essence through their choices and actions. Sartre believed that individuals create their own values, and this freedom to choose is both a source of liberation and a heavy responsibility, as each person must confront the consequences of their decisions.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, claimed that individuals must relinquish some personal freedoms to a sovereign authority to prevent society from descending into chaos. Hobbes argued that, left unchecked, people\u2019s actions would lead to conflict and violence, making it necessary to submit to a higher power that imposes order and security.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Sartre (Text 1) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 2) argument that individuals should surrender certain freedoms to maintain societal order? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that surrendering freedoms is essential, as people\u2019s choices need to be regulated to prevent chaos.", "B": "By suggesting that societal order is more important than individual freedom, as stability benefits everyone.", "C": "By asserting that a sovereign authority is necessary because people cannot make responsible decisions without external guidance.", "D": "By arguing that true freedom lies in each individual\u2019s responsibility to create values, and that submitting to authority compromises personal authenticity.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Sartre would likely argue that each individual is responsible for creating their own values, and that surrendering freedom to an authority would interfere with this process, reducing personal authenticity and responsibility.Choice A is incorrect; Sartre would not support regulating individual freedom in a way that limits self-determination.Choice C is incorrect; Sartre believes in individuals\u2019 responsibility to choose their values without relying on external authority.Choice D is incorrect; Sartre does not prioritize societal stability over individual freedom, as he views personal choice as paramount."}
