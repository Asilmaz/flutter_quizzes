{"introduction": "", "text": "Economist John Maynard Keynes argued in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money that during periods of economic downturn, government intervention is necessary to stimulate demand and reduce unemployment. Keynes advocated for increased public spending and investment to kickstart economic activity, believing that relying on market forces alone could prolong recessions and cause unnecessary suffering.", "text2": "Economist Friedrich Hayek, however, contended that government intervention distorts natural market adjustments, leading to inefficiencies. In The Road to Serfdom, Hayek argued that allowing the free market to correct itself, even during economic downturns, leads to healthier long-term growth. He believed that government spending interferes with the price mechanism, which he viewed as essential for economic stability.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hayek (Text 2) likely respond to Keynes\u2019s (Text 1) call for government spending to reduce unemployment in economic downturns? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that government spending has no impact on employment or economic recovery.", "B": "By suggesting that government intervention distorts the price mechanism and that a self-correcting free market is more effective for long-term stability.", "C": "By agreeing that increased government spending is essential for recovery during economic downturns.", "D": "By arguing that government intervention is only useful for raising taxes but not for reducing unemployment.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hayek believed that government intervention disrupts natural market functions, advocating instead for a free market to adjust itself, contrasting with Keynes\u2019s call for government spending to stimulate demand.Choice A is incorrect; Hayek opposes increased government spending in downturns.Choice C is incorrect; Hayek acknowledges government intervention\u2019s impact but views it as negative.Choice D is incorrect; Hayek does not support government intervention, even if it could influence taxes or unemployment."}
