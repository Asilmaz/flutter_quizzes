	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Astronomer Mark Holland’s team examined remnants of old planets from white dwarf atmospheres, concluding that lithium and sodium strongly indicate Earth-like continents existed around those stars.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu emphasize that the same elements can be present in various minerals that do not necessarily correspond to Earth-like rock types, warning against overinterpreting limited elemental data.",
	"question": "How would Putirka and Xu most likely respond to Holland’s assertion regarding planetary remnants?",
	"A": "They would likely question the interpretation, pointing out that the detected elements could be explained by non-Earth-like minerals.",
	"B": "They would concur fully, stating that these elements are irrefutable proof of continental crust formation.",
	"C": "They would propose that analyzing carbon dioxide levels is a better measure than looking for lithium or sodium.",
	"D": "They would deny that white dwarf atmospheres can contain any trace of exoplanet material at all.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because Text 2 says elements like lithium can appear in different rock types, meaning the presence of certain elements alone doesn’t confirm Earth-like continents. The other answers contradict that cautionary stance."
