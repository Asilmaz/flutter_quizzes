{"introduction": "", "text": "Poet T.S. Eliot argued in The Waste Land that modern poetry should reflect the fragmented and disorienting nature of contemporary life. Eliot believed that poetry must capture the complexity and chaos of modern existence, using disjointed imagery and multiple voices to mirror the uncertainty of the modern world, helping readers confront their own fragmented realities.", "text2": "Poet Robert Frost, however, valued clarity and simplicity in poetry. Frost argued that poetry should be accessible and focused on universal themes, like nature and human relationships, which resonate deeply with readers. He believed that poetry\u2019s strength lies in its ability to convey powerful emotions and insights clearly, without the need for complex or disjointed structures that might distance the audience.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Frost (Text 2) likely respond to Eliot\u2019s (Text 1) use of fragmented structure to capture modern life\u2019s complexity? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that fragmented structure is necessary for poetry to resonate with contemporary readers.", "B": "By arguing that poetry should be difficult to understand to reflect the complexity of human emotions.", "C": "By asserting that poetry should avoid universal themes and focus solely on abstract imagery.", "D": "By suggesting that poetry should use clear and accessible language to express universal themes, allowing readers to connect emotionally without being confused by disjointed forms.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
