{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued in Leviathan that humans are naturally self-interested and, without a strong central authority, would fall into a \u201cstate of nature\u201d characterized by chaos and conflict. Hobbes believed that for society to function peacefully, individuals must surrender certain freedoms to a sovereign power capable of maintaining order and enforcing laws.", "text2": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in The Social Contract, argued that while individuals are born free, they create a social contract to ensure mutual protection and cooperation. Unlike Hobbes, Rousseau believed that legitimate government is based on the collective will of the people, prioritizing the community\u2019s welfare over authoritarian control. For Rousseau, government authority must derive from the people\u2019s consent.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rousseau (Text 2) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 1) idea that individuals must surrender freedoms to a strong central authority for societal peace? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that all forms of government should be abolished to allow unrestricted freedom.", "B": "By suggesting that true government authority must be based on the collective will and consent of the people, emphasizing cooperation rather than authoritarian control.", "C": "By agreeing that a sovereign authority should have absolute control to maintain social order.", "D": "By arguing that societal peace should be maintained solely through individual self-interest, without any governing authority.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rousseau believes in a government rooted in the collective will and consent of the people, which contrasts with Hobbes\u2019s view of a central authority enforcing order.Choice A is incorrect; Rousseau would not agree with absolute control by a sovereign.Choice C is incorrect; Rousseau does not advocate for the abolition of all government, as he values mutual cooperation and the social contract.Choice D is incorrect; Rousseau emphasizes collective will rather than relying solely on individual self-interest for societal order."}
