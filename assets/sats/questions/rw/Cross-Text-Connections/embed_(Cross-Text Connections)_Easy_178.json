{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jeremy Bentham argued in An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences, particularly in terms of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. Bentham believed that actions should be judged by their utility, meaning their ability to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.", "text2": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant, in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, argued that morality is based on duty and adherence to universal principles, rather than consequences. Kant believed that ethical actions are those performed out of respect for moral laws that could be universally applied, regardless of the potential outcomes. For Kant, true morality involves acting according to one\u2019s duty and principles, rather than aiming for happiness or utility.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Kant (Text 2) likely respond to Bentham\u2019s (Text 1) view that actions should be judged by their ability to produce happiness? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that only self-interest, not happiness or duty, should determine moral decisions.", "B": "By suggesting that true morality comes from following universal principles and acting out of duty, rather than considering the happiness or utility of an outcome.", "C": "By agreeing that happiness is the primary measure of moral actions.", "D": "By arguing that ethical actions must always prioritize individual pleasure over universal principles.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Kant believes that morality should be guided by universal principles and duty, contrasting with Bentham\u2019s view that actions should be evaluated based on the happiness they produce.Choice A is incorrect; Kant does not agree that happiness is the primary measure of moral actions.Choice C is incorrect; Kant does not advocate for self-interest as a basis for morality.Choice D is incorrect; Kant does not prioritize individual pleasure over adherence to moral principles."}
