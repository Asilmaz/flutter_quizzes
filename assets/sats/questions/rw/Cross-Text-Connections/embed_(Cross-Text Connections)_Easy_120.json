{"introduction": "", "text": "Environmental scientist Aldo Leopold argued in A Sand County Almanac that humans have a moral responsibility to protect wilderness. Leopold believed that all elements of an ecosystem, from the smallest plant to the largest animal, are interconnected and that disrupting one part of the system could harm the whole. He advocated for a land ethic that respects and preserves natural environments.", "text2": "Economist Julian Simon, however, contended that humans should prioritize economic growth and innovation over wilderness preservation. Simon argued that human ingenuity allows us to adapt to environmental challenges and that natural resources should be used to improve human welfare, as technology can mitigate environmental damage while meeting human needs.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Simon (Text 2) likely respond to Leopold\u2019s (Text 1) call for wilderness preservation as a moral responsibility? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that while wilderness has value, economic growth and human innovation are the best tools to address environmental challenges.", "B": "By agreeing that all elements of an ecosystem should be preserved regardless of human needs.", "C": "By asserting that wilderness preservation has no relevance to human welfare.", "D": "By arguing that technological advancement eliminates the need to consider environmental impacts.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Simon recognizes the value of wilderness but argues that human welfare and economic growth should take precedence, with technology helping to address environmental concerns, providing a contrasting perspective to Leopold\u2019s conservationist approach.Choice A is incorrect; Simon prioritizes economic growth over strict preservation.Choice C is incorrect; Simon acknowledges the relevance of environmental issues but favors human adaptation.Choice D is incorrect; Simon does not suggest ignoring environmental impacts but relies on technology as a solution."}
