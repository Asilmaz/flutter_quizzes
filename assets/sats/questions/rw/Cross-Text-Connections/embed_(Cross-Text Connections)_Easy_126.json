{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued in Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals that morality is rooted in duty and rationality. Kant believed that individuals should act according to universal moral laws that they would want everyone to follow, a principle he termed the \u201ccategorical imperative.\u201d According to Kant, actions are morally right if they are done from a sense of duty, rather than for personal gain.", "text2": "Philosopher David Hume, however, claimed that moral judgments stem from emotions and feelings rather than rational duty. Hume argued that people are guided by sympathy and empathy, and that human moral responses are inherently emotional, not the result of logical rules. He believed that ethics are based on human sentiments rather than objective, rational principles.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hume (Text 2) likely respond to Kant\u2019s (Text 1) view on the role of duty and rationality in morality? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that moral decisions are rooted more in emotions and human sympathy than in logical rules.", "B": "By asserting that morality has no relation to human emotions or feelings.", "C": "By agreeing that morality is best defined by rational duties and universal principles.", "D": "By arguing that ethical actions are solely based on self-interest, not duty or emotion.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
