{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, argued that individuals should strive to become \u201c\u00dcbermenschen\u201d or \u201covermen,\u201d transcending conventional moralities to create their own values. Nietzsche believed that individuals should not be bound by societal norms but instead embrace their will to power to reach their fullest potential.", "text2": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant, in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, proposed that morality is based on universal principles that apply to all rational beings. Kant argued that actions are only morally right if they can be universally applied, regardless of individual desires or personal gain, emphasizing duty over personal ambition.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Kant (Text 2) likely respond to Nietzsche\u2019s (Text 1) argument that individuals should create their own values independently of societal norms? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that morality should be based on universal principles rather than personal values, as ethical actions are defined by their ability to be universally applied.", "B": "By agreeing that individuals should reject societal norms, as personal values are the only true path to ethical living.", "C": "By arguing that only those with exceptional intellectual abilities should create their own values, while others follow societal rules.", "D": "By asserting that individual ambition and personal values are essential to achieving a morally just society.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Kant would likely argue that morality must be grounded in universal principles, not individual values, as ethical actions are those that can be applied consistently to all rational beings.Choice A is incorrect; Kant would not agree with rejecting societal norms in favor of personal values, as he emphasizes universality in ethics.Choice C is incorrect; Kant does not believe that only some individuals should create values, but rather that morality is universal.Choice D is incorrect; Kant does not prioritize individual ambition or personal values, as he centers morality on duty and universality rather than individual achievement."}
