{"introduction": "", "text": "Ecologist Rachel Carson noted that many bird species rely on specific habitats to survive, with certain coastal birds needing salt marshes for nesting and food sources.", "text2": "Ornithologist John Terborgh argues that while habitat is crucial, competition for resources within these areas also determines where bird populations can thrive, often limiting their range.", "question": "Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?", "A": "Most bird species can thrive in any habitat without limitations.", "B": "Bird species require specific habitats to meet their survival needs.", "C": "Habitat is less important to birds than genetic adaptation.", "D": "Coastal bird populations are growing due to increased resource availability.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "A is the best answer. Both authors emphasize that specific habitats are crucial to birds\u2019 survival, with Carson highlighting habitat needs and Terborgh discussing resource competition within them.Choice B is incorrect; both authors note limitations.Choice C is incorrect; habitat, not genetics, is discussed as essential.Choice D is incorrect; population growth is not mentioned."}
