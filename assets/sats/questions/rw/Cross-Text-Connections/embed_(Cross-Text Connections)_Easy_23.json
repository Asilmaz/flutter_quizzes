{"introduction": "", "text": "Astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that the universe expanded gradually over billions of years, allowing galaxies to form and evolve over immense periods.", "text2": "Physicist Alan Guth proposed the theory of cosmic inflation, suggesting that the universe underwent a rapid expansion within seconds after the Big Bang, before slowing to a gradual rate.", "question": "Which choice best describes a difference in how Sagan (Text 1) and Guth (Text 2) view the universe\u2019s expansion?", "A": "Sagan believes the expansion was faster than Guth suggests.", "B": "Guth suggests galaxies formed instantly after the Big Bang.", "C": "Guth believes the universe is contracting rather than expanding.", "D": "Sagan views the expansion as gradual, while Guth describes a rapid initial expansion.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Sagan describes a gradual expansion, while Guth describes an initial rapid inflation before a slower expansion.Choice A is incorrect; Guth describes a faster initial expansion.Choice C is incorrect; both describe expansion, not contraction.Choice D is incorrect; galaxy formation was not immediate in Guth's theory."}
