{"introduction": "", "text": "Literary critics have observed that in George Orwell\u2019s 1984, the portrayal of government surveillance and propaganda reflects Orwell\u2019s fear of totalitarianism. The novel warns about the dangers of absolute political control over society and the erosion of individual freedoms, highlighting the potential loss of privacy and autonomy.", "text2": "Historian Hannah Arendt, while agreeing with Orwell on the dangers of totalitarianism, emphasized that such regimes are rooted not only in surveillance but also in the systematic isolation and atomization of individuals. Arendt argued that totalitarianism succeeds by dismantling social bonds, leaving people isolated and thus more susceptible to manipulation.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Arendt (Text 2) likely respond to Orwell\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on surveillance as a primary threat? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that surveillance alone is the most powerful tool of totalitarian regimes.", "B": "By arguing that surveillance is irrelevant to understanding totalitarianism.", "C": "By asserting that totalitarian regimes do not rely on surveillance or social isolation.", "D": "By suggesting that while surveillance is a danger, the breakdown of social bonds is equally essential for maintaining totalitarian control.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Arendt acknowledges the importance of surveillance in totalitarian regimes but believes that the erosion of social bonds is equally crucial for establishing control, providing a broader perspective than Orwell\u2019s focus on surveillance alone.Choice A is incorrect; Arendt sees social isolation as an additional critical factor.Choice C is incorrect; Arendt views both surveillance and social isolation as tools of totalitarianism.Choice D is incorrect; Arendt considers surveillance relevant, though not the sole factor in totalitarian control."}
