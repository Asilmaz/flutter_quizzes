{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher John Rawls proposed the concept of \u201cjustice as fairness,\u201d suggesting that a just society should be structured to ensure that the least advantaged members are supported. Rawls argued that principles of justice should be chosen from behind a \u201cveil of ignorance,\u201d where individuals make decisions without knowing their own social status, ensuring unbiased, fair outcomes.", "text2": "Philosopher Robert Nozick disagreed, arguing that justice is based on individual rights and freedom rather than equality of outcomes. Nozick believed that individuals should be free to acquire and transfer property as they choose, as long as their actions respect others\u2019 rights. He contended that redistribution of wealth by the state infringes upon personal liberty and property rights.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Nozick (Text 2) likely respond to Rawls\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on redistributive justice to support disadvantaged members of society? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that society should prioritize equality and ensure everyone has the same opportunities.", "B": "By arguing that fairness can only be achieved through complete wealth redistribution by the state.", "C": "By asserting that only the wealthy deserve justice, as they contribute more to society.", "D": "By suggesting that justice should focus on protecting individual freedom rather than mandating redistributive policies.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Nozick prioritizes individual rights and freedom over redistributive justice, viewing mandatory redistribution as an infringement on personal liberty, which contrasts with Rawls\u2019s view that justice requires supporting the least advantaged.Choice A is incorrect; Nozick does not support equality as the primary goal.Choice C is incorrect; Nozick does not argue that justice is exclusive to the wealthy.Choice D is incorrect; Nozick opposes wealth redistribution as a form of justice."}
