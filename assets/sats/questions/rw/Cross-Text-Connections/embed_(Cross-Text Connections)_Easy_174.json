{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Aristotle argued in Nicomachean Ethics that virtue lies in moderation, proposing his concept of the \u201cGolden Mean.\u201d Aristotle believed that moral virtue is achieved by finding a balanced path between extremes, such as courage being the balance between recklessness and cowardice. For him, ethical behavior requires practical wisdom to navigate and choose the middle ground in various situations.", "text2": "Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, however, argued in Thus Spoke Zarathustra that individuals should not strive for balance but instead pursue greatness through embracing their unique strengths and desires. Nietzsche criticized the idea of moderation, viewing it as limiting and contrary to human potential. He believed that true fulfillment is achieved by living boldly and passionately, even if it means challenging conventional notions of virtue.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Nietzsche (Text 2) likely respond to Aristotle\u2019s (Text 1) concept of the \u201cGolden Mean\u201d? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that moderation is the best way to achieve moral virtue.", "B": "By asserting that morality is irrelevant to human potential and self-expression.", "C": "By suggesting that true fulfillment comes from embracing one\u2019s unique desires and strengths, rather than seeking balance or moderation in actions.", "D": "By arguing that individuals should avoid extremes only to maintain social harmony, rather than for personal growth.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
