{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Karl Marx, in The Communist Manifesto, argued that class struggles drive historical development and that the working class, or proletariat, should unite to overthrow the ruling class, or bourgeoisie. Marx envisioned a society without class distinctions, where resources are shared, and each person contributes according to their ability and receives according to their need.", "text2": "Philosopher Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations, advocated for free markets, where individuals acting in their self-interest lead to economic prosperity. Smith believed that competition in an open market benefits society as a whole by encouraging efficiency, innovation, and the distribution of resources according to demand.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Smith (Text 2) likely respond to Marx\u2019s (Text 1) argument that class struggle should end with the proletariat overthrowing the bourgeoisie to create a classless society? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that a classless society is ideal, as it prevents exploitation and leads to a fairer distribution of resources.", "B": "By suggesting that free markets naturally balance economic disparities by rewarding individual initiative and competition, rather than relying on a class revolution.", "C": "By asserting that overthrowing the bourgeoisie is essential for societal progress, as individual wealth inevitably leads to corruption and inequality.", "D": "By arguing that class distinctions are unimportant and have no effect on economic or social development.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
