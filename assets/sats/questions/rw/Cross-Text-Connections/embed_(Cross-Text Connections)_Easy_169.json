{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued in Leviathan that human beings are naturally self-interested, and without a strong central authority, life would devolve into a \u201cstate of nature\u201d marked by chaos and conflict. Hobbes believed that to ensure peace, individuals should surrender certain freedoms to a sovereign power that can enforce laws and maintain order.", "text2": "Philosopher John Locke, however, argued in Two Treatises of Government that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property, which should be protected rather than surrendered. Locke believed that governments are established to protect these rights, not to exercise absolute control. He argued that if a government fails to uphold these rights, citizens have the authority to reform or replace it.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Locke (Text 2) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 1) view that individuals should surrender their freedoms to a sovereign for the sake of peace? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that individuals should surrender all freedoms to ensure a peaceful society.", "B": "By suggesting that individuals possess natural rights that should be protected, and governments should exist to defend these rights rather than demand absolute submission.", "C": "By asserting that peace is irrelevant to the role of government in a society.", "D": "By arguing that individuals should prioritize societal harmony over their personal freedoms and rights.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
