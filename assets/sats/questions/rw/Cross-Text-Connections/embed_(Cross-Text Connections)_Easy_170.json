{"introduction": "", "text": "Political theorist Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued in The Social Contract that true freedom is achieved when individuals align their personal interests with the \u201cgeneral will\u201d of society. Rousseau believed that people can only be truly free when they participate in collective decision-making, as this represents the common good over individual desires.", "text2": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, in On Liberty, argued that individual freedom is essential for personal development and societal progress. Mill believed that individuals should have the liberty to pursue their own interests as long as they do not harm others. He maintained that personal freedom fosters creativity and diversity, which he viewed as crucial for a thriving society.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 2) likely respond to Rousseau\u2019s (Text 1) view that freedom is achieved by aligning with the \u201cgeneral will\u201d? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that societal progress depends entirely on everyone following the same values.", "B": "By agreeing that individual freedom should be subordinated to society\u2019s general will for the common good.", "C": "By arguing that individual interests should always be aligned with societal norms without exception.", "D": "By suggesting that true freedom requires personal autonomy, where individuals are free to make choices that do not harm others, rather than conforming to a collective will.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Mill believes that personal autonomy is essential for true freedom, contrasting with Rousseau\u2019s idea that aligning with the \u201cgeneral will\u201d is the path to freedom.Choice A is incorrect; Mill does not support subordinating individual freedom to the collective will.Choice C is incorrect; Mill values diversity and individual choices over uniformity.Choice D is incorrect; Mill does not advocate strict alignment with societal norms, valuing individual freedom instead."}
