{"introduction": "", "text": "Psychologist Paul Ekman\u2019s research suggests that basic facial expressions like happiness, sadness, and fear are universally recognized across cultures, indicating that these expressions may be biologically rooted.", "text2": "Anthropologist Margaret Mead argued that emotions and their expressions vary significantly by culture. She believed that emotional expression is largely learned through cultural interaction, challenging the idea of universal expressions.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mead (Text 2) most likely respond to Ekman\u2019s (Text 1) conclusion about facial expressions?", "A": "By suggesting that basic emotions are more easily expressed in some cultures.", "B": "By arguing that facial expressions are only partially influenced by biology.", "C": "By asserting that emotions are universally understood regardless of expression.", "D": "By claiming that emotional expressions are largely a cultural construct.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "C is the best answer. Mead believes that expressions are learned and culturally specific, which contrasts with Ekman\u2019s view of universality.Choice A is incorrect; Mead emphasizes cultural variation, not universality.Choice B is incorrect; Mead views expressions as predominantly learned, not biologically influenced.Choice D is incorrect; Mead\u2019s argument is about cultural learning, not ease of expression."}
