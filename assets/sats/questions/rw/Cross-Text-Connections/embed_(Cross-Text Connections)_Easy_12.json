	"text": "Text 1: White dwarf atmospheres can contain trace elements that offer clues about exoplanets that once orbited the star. Finding lithium and sodium may suggest that those exoplanets had continental crusts similar to Earthâ€™s, according to some astronomers.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Another group points out that individual elements like lithium can appear in many different minerals, including types not found on Earth. Therefore, relying on a few trace elements to infer Earth-like crust might be misleading.",
	"question": "How would the astronomers in Text 2 most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 about Earth-like crusts on exoplanets?",
	"A": "They would grant that lithium is only found in Earth-like crusts, confirming the argument in Text 1.",
	"B": "They would argue it is premature to conclude that these exoplanets had Earth-like surfaces based on limited elemental data.",
	"C": "They would claim that sodium and lithium cannot be detected in any white dwarf atmospheres.",
	"D": "They would suggest that lithium is unrelated to crust formation and is found only in gas giants.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 2 cautions against tying a few elements to the definite presence of Earth-like crusts. The other options either deny the elements appear at all or misinterpret their significance."
