{"introduction": "", "text": "Biologist Rachel Carson argued that the use of pesticides harms bird populations by contaminating their food sources, ultimately threatening entire ecosystems.", "text2": "Environmental scientist John Burnett acknowledges Carson\u2019s concerns but suggests that birds\u2019 resilience and adaptive behaviors may lessen the long-term impacts of pesticide exposure.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Burnett (Text 2) most likely respond to Carson\u2019s (Text 1) conclusion about pesticides?", "A": "By emphasizing that pesticides pose no threat to birds.", "B": "By asserting that pesticide use is irrelevant to bird populations.", "C": "By claiming pesticides are beneficial for all ecosystems.", "D": "By arguing that birds can adapt to some level of pesticide exposure.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Burnett believes that while pesticides harm birds, their adaptability may mitigate some effects, contrasting Carson\u2019s more dire view.Choice A is incorrect; Burnett does not dismiss the threat entirely.Choice C is incorrect; neither text suggests pesticides are universally beneficial.Choice D is incorrect; both texts discuss pesticides\u2019 relevance to bird populations."}
