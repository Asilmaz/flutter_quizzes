{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that humans are inherently good but are corrupted by society. He believed that in a \u201cstate of nature,\u201d people would act compassionately and harmoniously. According to Rousseau, social structures introduce competition, inequality, and selfishness, leading people away from their natural kindness and simplicity.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, on the other hand, contended that humans in a \u201cstate of nature\u201d would act out of self-interest, leading to conflict and a \u201cwar of all against all.\u201d Hobbes argued that without a strong governing authority, humans would descend into chaos, as they are inherently competitive and driven by self-preservation.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hobbes (Text 2) likely respond to Rousseau\u2019s (Text 1) idea that humans are naturally compassionate? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that humans are naturally self-interested and need authority to maintain order.", "B": "By claiming that society has no influence on human nature.", "C": "By agreeing that humans are inherently good and only corrupted by society.", "D": "By arguing that humans are solely driven by kindness in a state of nature.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hobbes believes that humans are naturally self-interested and that society requires authority to prevent chaos, which contrasts with Rousseau\u2019s idea of inherent human compassion.Choice A is incorrect; Hobbes does not believe humans are inherently good.Choice C is incorrect; Hobbes acknowledges the role of authority, suggesting it shapes behavior.Choice D is incorrect; Hobbes argues for self-interest, not kindness, as the primary human motivation."}
