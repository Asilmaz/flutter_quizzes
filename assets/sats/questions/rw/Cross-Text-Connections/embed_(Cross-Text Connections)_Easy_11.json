	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Some historians suggest that the Chicxulub asteroid alone triggered the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction, given how precisely it aligns with the timeframe of the mass die-off.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Critics note that large volcanic eruptions also coincide with mass extinction events and stress that the Deccan Traps eruptions occurred around the same period, releasing climate-altering gases that could have significantly impacted global ecosystems.",
	"question": "If the author of Text 2 were to respond to the claim in Text 1, what would be the likely perspective?",
	"A": "They would clarify that the timing of the asteroid strike does not coincide with any known extinction event.",
	"B": "They would question whether multiple geologic factors, not just an asteroid impact, contributed to the extinction.",
	"C": "They would suggest that volcanic activity is irrelevant to the K-Pg eventâ€™s outcomes.",
	"D": "They would conclude that no real evidence supports the occurrence of large-scale eruptions at that time.",
	"correct": "B",
	"explanation": "Choice B is correct because Text 2 introduces volcanic activity as another major factor, implying that focusing solely on the asteroid event ignores the role of simultaneous eruptions. The other choices contradict the given data."
