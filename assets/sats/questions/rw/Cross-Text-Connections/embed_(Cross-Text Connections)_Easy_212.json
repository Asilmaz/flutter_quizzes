{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Michel Foucault, in Discipline and Punish, explored how societal institutions such as prisons, schools, and hospitals exert power over individuals by shaping behavior through surveillance and discipline. Foucault argued that this subtle form of control, which he called \u201cdisciplinary power,\u201d limits individual freedom by enforcing norms that individuals unconsciously internalize.", "text2": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, in On Liberty, argued for the importance of individual freedom and autonomy, stating that society should only limit an individual\u2019s actions if they cause harm to others. Mill believed that personal growth and societal progress depend on allowing individuals to think and act freely, without interference from social institutions or public opinion.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 2) likely respond to Foucault\u2019s (Text 1) view that institutions shape individuals\u2019 behavior through disciplinary power? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that institutions should guide individuals\u2019 behavior, as it leads to a more organized and efficient society.", "B": "By suggesting that social institutions are essential to individual growth, as they provide a structure for individuals to make better choices.", "C": "By arguing that true progress relies on minimizing institutional control over individuals, as excessive discipline undermines personal autonomy and freedom.", "D": "By asserting that institutions need disciplinary power to prevent individuals from acting in harmful ways and maintain social order.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Mill would likely argue that minimizing institutional control is essential for personal freedom and growth, as he advocates for individual autonomy unless an action directly harms others.Choice A is incorrect; Mill does not believe that institutions should guide behavior in a way that restricts individual liberty.Choice C is incorrect; while Mill values order, he believes it should not come at the expense of personal freedom.Choice D is incorrect; Mill does not support extensive institutional influence, as he emphasizes freedom from external control."}
