{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher John Locke, in Two Treatises of Government, argued that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property, which governments are obligated to protect. Locke believed that a government\u2019s legitimacy comes from its ability to secure these rights, and that citizens have the right to resist or replace any government that fails to uphold them.", "text2": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, contended that individuals must surrender certain freedoms to an absolute authority in exchange for security and social order. Hobbes argued that, without this authority, life would be chaotic, as individuals would act in self-interest, leading to conflict and instability.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Locke (Text 1) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 2) argument that an absolute authority is necessary to maintain order? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that the role of government is to protect individual rights, and that absolute authority is dangerous as it can infringe on these fundamental rights.", "B": "By agreeing that absolute authority is essential for maintaining order and that individual rights should be secondary to social stability.", "C": "By suggesting that government should have no role in people\u2019s lives and that individual freedom alone is sufficient to ensure societal harmony.", "D": "By asserting that all freedoms should be surrendered to a government that ensures peace and order, even if it limits personal liberties.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Locke would likely argue that government exists primarily to protect individual rights, and that absolute authority poses a risk to these rights if it becomes oppressive or fails to respect personal liberties.Choice A is incorrect; Locke does not believe that individual rights should be secondary to order or stability.Choice C is incorrect; Locke does not advocate for a lack of government but rather for a government that protects rights.Choice D is incorrect; Locke would not support surrendering all freedoms, as he emphasizes the protection of natural rights as a government\u2019s primary role."}
