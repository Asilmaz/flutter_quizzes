{"introduction": "", "text": "Geologist Charles Lyell argued that Earth's geological features developed gradually over immense periods, shaped by processes such as erosion and sedimentation, a theory known as uniformitarianism.", "text2": "Geologist Georges Cuvier, in contrast, believed that Earth\u2019s landscape was primarily formed by catastrophic events like floods and volcanic eruptions, which caused sudden and dramatic changes.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Cuvier (Text 2) likely respond to Lyell\u2019s (Text 1) view on geological processes? Provide reasoning for your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that Earth\u2019s features developed through slow, gradual processes.", "B": "By arguing that sudden catastrophic events shaped Earth\u2019s features.", "C": "By asserting that geological processes ceased after Earth\u2019s formation.", "D": "By suggesting that erosion has had no impact on Earth\u2019s landscape.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Cuvier supports the idea that Earth\u2019s features were shaped by sudden events, contrasting with Lyell\u2019s view of gradual processes.Choice A is incorrect; Cuvier emphasizes sudden changes, not gradual ones.Choice C is incorrect; both texts discuss ongoing geological processes.Choice D is incorrect; neither text denies the impact of erosion."}
