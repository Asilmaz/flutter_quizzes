	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Early attempts to date Australopithecus africanus fossils in the Sterkfontein Caves proved inconclusive due to the mixture of sediment layers and the relocation of animal bones by flooding events. These issues complicated stratigraphic and comparative dating methods.",
	"text2": "Text 2: More recent cosmogenic nuclide dating focused on the breccia surrounding the fossils, avoiding pitfalls of misaligned soil layers or displaced animal remains. This approach yielded revised estimates of the fossilsâ€™ age.",
	"question": "How would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the challenges mentioned in Text 1?",
	"A": "They would consider the earlier attempts to be just as precise as modern methods.",
	"B": "They would argue that analyzing the fossils themselves is unnecessary for accurate dating results.",
	"C": "They would note that studying the breccia specifically circumvents the problems posed by mixed layers and displaced bones.",
	"D": "They would conclude that Australopithecus africanus fossils cannot be accurately dated using any known method.",
	"correct": "C",
	"explanation": "Choice C is correct because Text 2 highlights how cosmogenic nuclide analysis of the breccia addresses the pitfalls of older methods. The other choices conflict with or overlook the specifics of the new dating technique."
