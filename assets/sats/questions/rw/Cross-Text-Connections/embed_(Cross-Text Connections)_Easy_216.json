{"introduction": "", "text": "In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that individuals gain freedom by entering into a social contract, where they surrender some personal liberties for the common good. Rousseau believed that true freedom arises when individuals align their personal interests with the collective will, ensuring equality and cooperation in society.", "text2": "In Walden, Henry David Thoreau emphasized the importance of self-reliance and individualism, arguing that societal expectations often suppress personal freedom. Thoreau believed that individuals should prioritize personal values over societal norms and live in harmony with nature to achieve true independence.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Thoreau (Text 2) likely respond to Rousseau\u2019s (Text 1) idea that surrendering some individual freedoms to a social contract leads to true freedom? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that individual freedom should always be secondary to the collective will to maintain societal harmony.", "B": "By agreeing that societal cooperation is essential for achieving personal independence and harmony with nature.", "C": "By arguing that true freedom requires individuals to reject societal expectations entirely and prioritize self-reliance.", "D": "By suggesting that a balance between individual freedom and societal expectations is necessary for achieving independence.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Thoreau would likely argue that true freedom is achieved through self-reliance and rejecting societal expectations, as he prioritizes personal independence over aligning with collective norms.Choice A is incorrect; Thoreau does not emphasize societal cooperation as essential for independence.Choice C is incorrect; Thoreau would not argue for subordinating individual freedom to the collective will, as he values personal autonomy.Choice D is incorrect; while this response seems balanced, Thoreau\u2019s philosophy does not support compromising individual freedom for societal expectations."}
