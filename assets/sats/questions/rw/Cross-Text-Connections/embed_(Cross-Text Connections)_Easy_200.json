{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant, in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, argued that morality is rooted in rationality and that individuals should act according to a categorical imperative\u2014a universal moral law that one would want to apply to all rational beings. Kant believed that actions are morally right if they are done out of a sense of duty, rather than for personal gain or inclination.", "text2": "Philosopher David Hume, in A Treatise of Human Nature, contended that moral judgments are not derived from reason alone but are grounded in human emotions and empathy. Hume argued that moral distinctions arise from feelings of approval or disapproval that we naturally experience, making morality more a matter of sentiment than rational law.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hume (Text 2) likely respond to Kant\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that morality should be guided by a universal rational law rather than individual inclinations or emotions? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that morality should be based on reason alone, disregarding emotions, to ensure universal consistency.", "B": "By asserting that all moral judgments are irrelevant, as there is no rational basis or emotional foundation for ethical decision-making.", "C": "By arguing that morality is dictated solely by individual desires, without any need for reason or empathy.", "D": "By suggesting that moral distinctions arise from human emotions and sentiments, emphasizing that morality is shaped by empathy rather than rational, universal laws.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hume would argue that moral judgments stem from human emotions and sentiments, not purely from rational laws, and that empathy plays a significant role in shaping morality.Choice A is incorrect; Hume does not believe in basing morality solely on reason.Choice C is incorrect; Hume would not deny the relevance of moral judgments but would root them in emotional response rather than pure rationality.Choice D is incorrect; Hume does not suggest that morality is dictated solely by individual desires; rather, he highlights the role of empathy and shared human feelings."}
