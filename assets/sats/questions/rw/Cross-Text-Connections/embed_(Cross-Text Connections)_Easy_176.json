{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher John Locke argued in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding that knowledge is derived from sensory experience. Locke believed that the mind begins as a blank slate (\u201ctabula rasa\u201d), and that all ideas come from experience, which means knowledge is acquired through interacting with the world. For Locke, reason and knowledge grow as individuals accumulate and reflect upon their sensory experiences.", "text2": "Philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, in Meditations on First Philosophy, argued that certain knowledge comes from innate ideas rather than sensory experience. Descartes believed that foundational truths, such as the existence of the self (\u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d), are known through reason and not reliant on sensory input. He saw reason as the primary tool for discovering truth, independent of the unreliable senses.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Descartes (Text 2) likely respond to Locke\u2019s (Text 1) idea that knowledge is exclusively derived from sensory experience? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that sensory experience is the only path to true knowledge.", "B": "By arguing that knowledge should rely on external authorities rather than personal experience or reason.", "C": "By asserting that knowledge is neither derived from sensory experience nor from innate ideas.", "D": "By suggesting that innate ideas, which do not come from experience, form the basis of certain fundamental knowledge, and that reason alone can access these truths independently of sensory input.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Descartes values innate ideas and reason as the primary sources of foundational knowledge, contrasting with Locke\u2019s view that knowledge is solely acquired through sensory experience.Choice A is incorrect; Descartes does not agree that sensory experience is the sole source of knowledge.Choice C is incorrect; Descartes does believe knowledge can stem from innate ideas, even if he is skeptical of sensory input.Choice D is incorrect; Descartes values reason over reliance on external authority or sensory-based knowledge."}
