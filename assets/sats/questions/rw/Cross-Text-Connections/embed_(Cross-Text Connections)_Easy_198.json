{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, in Existentialism is a Humanism, argued that existence precedes essence, meaning that individuals are born without any predetermined purpose. According to Sartre, humans must create their own essence through their choices, actions, and the responsibility they take for defining themselves in a world without inherent meaning.", "text2": "Philosopher Aristotle, in Nicomachean Ethics, argued that the purpose or essence of human life is to achieve eudaimonia, often translated as \u201cflourishing\u201d or \u201cthe good life.\u201d Aristotle believed that this is accomplished through the cultivation of virtues, by which individuals fulfill their nature and achieve a life of balance and moral excellence.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Sartre (Text 1) likely respond to Aristotle\u2019s (Text 2) idea that human life has an inherent purpose or essence that is achieved through virtue? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that humans are born with a purpose that is achieved through moral excellence and balance.", "B": "By asserting that human life has no value, purpose, or potential for fulfillment, and that any search for meaning is entirely pointless.", "C": "By suggesting that while virtues are valuable, individuals have no inherent essence and must define themselves through personal choices rather than by fulfilling a pre-established purpose.", "D": "By arguing that virtues are irrelevant and that human life should be dedicated solely to the pursuit of pleasure.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Sartre would emphasize that humans are not born with any inherent essence or purpose, and that it is through personal choice and responsibility that individuals define themselves, rather than by fulfilling a pre-established purpose.Choice A is incorrect; Sartre does not believe in any inherent purpose that humans must fulfill.Choice C is incorrect; while Sartre emphasizes the responsibility of creating meaning, he does not suggest that life is pointless.Choice D is incorrect; Sartre would not reduce human life to the mere pursuit of pleasure, as he stresses responsibility and personal choice in defining one\u2019s essence."}
