{"introduction": "", "text": "Geologist James Hutton proposed that Earth\u2019s landscapes formed gradually over vast timescales, shaped by erosion, sedimentation, and other slow processes\u2014a theory later known as \u201cuniformitarianism.\u201d", "text2": "Geophysicist Harold Jeffreys challenged uniformitarianism by suggesting that sudden, large-scale events, like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, played a more significant role in shaping Earth\u2019s surface.", "question": "Which choice best describes a difference in how Hutton (Text 1) and Jeffreys (Text 2) view geological processes?", "A": "Hutton believes in rapid landscape changes, while Jeffreys emphasizes gradual change.", "B": "Hutton argues for slow processes, whereas Jeffreys emphasizes sudden events.", "C": "Jeffreys supports erosion as Earth\u2019s primary shaping force, unlike Hutton.", "D": "Both believe gradual processes alone shape Earth\u2019s landscapes.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hutton supports slow, gradual processes, while Jeffreys highlights the role of sudden, large-scale events.Choice A is incorrect; Hutton advocates gradual changes.Choice C is incorrect; Jeffreys emphasizes sudden events, not erosion.Choice D is incorrect; Jeffreys does not support gradual processes alone."}
