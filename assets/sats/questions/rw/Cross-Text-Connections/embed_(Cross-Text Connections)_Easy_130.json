{"introduction": "", "text": "Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that income inequality harms economic growth by limiting opportunities for large segments of the population. In The Price of Inequality, Stiglitz suggests that high inequality reduces social mobility, lowers overall demand, and fosters social tensions, ultimately hindering long-term economic stability.", "text2": "Economist Milton Friedman, however, contends that inequality is a natural outcome of a free-market economy and can incentivize productivity and innovation. Friedman believes that economic growth depends on rewarding individual achievement and that efforts to reduce inequality through government intervention disrupt the market, potentially slowing progress and reducing incentives.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Friedman (Text 2) likely respond to Stiglitz\u2019s (Text 1) argument that inequality harms economic stability? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that reducing inequality is essential for achieving stable economic growth.", "B": "By arguing that economic stability is best achieved by removing all incentives and rewards for individual achievement.", "C": "By asserting that inequality has no effect on economic growth or social mobility.", "D": "By suggesting that inequality can drive economic growth by incentivizing productivity and should not be interfered with by the government.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Friedman argues that inequality serves as a motivator in a free market, driving productivity and innovation, and he believes that government intervention to reduce inequality could hinder these benefits, countering Stiglitz\u2019s view.Choice A is incorrect; Friedman does not view reducing inequality as beneficial for growth.Choice C is incorrect; Friedman acknowledges inequality\u2019s role in economic growth but sees it as positive.Choice D is incorrect; Friedman supports incentives and rewards as essential for economic stability."}
