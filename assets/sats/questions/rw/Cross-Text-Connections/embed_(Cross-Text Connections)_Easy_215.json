{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, in Beyond Good and Evil, challenged traditional notions of morality, arguing that values such as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d are socially constructed. Nietzsche believed in the concept of the \u201cwill to power,\u201d where individuals create their own values, rejecting societal norms that limit personal growth and self-expression. He argued that people should strive to rise above conventional morality to achieve true individuality.", "text2": "Philosopher John Stuart Mill, in Utilitarianism, argued that actions are morally right if they maximize happiness and reduce suffering. Mill believed in the \u201cgreatest happiness principle,\u201d which holds that the moral value of an action depends on its contribution to overall happiness. For Mill, morality is defined by the collective benefit, rather than individual self-expression.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Mill (Text 2) likely respond to Nietzsche\u2019s (Text 1) argument that individuals should reject societal norms to achieve true individuality? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that morality must prioritize the happiness and well-being of society as a whole, rather than focusing solely on individual freedom.", "B": "By agreeing that individuality is more important than collective well-being, as true moral values come from personal expression.", "C": "By suggesting that conventional moral values are unnecessary and individuals should freely create their own sense of right and wrong.", "D": "By asserting that societal norms should always be respected, as they are essential for maintaining personal happiness and growth.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Mill would likely argue that morality is based on promoting collective happiness and reducing suffering, so prioritizing individual self-expression above societal well-being would conflict with his utilitarian values.Choice A is incorrect; Mill emphasizes collective well-being over personal freedom.Choice C is incorrect; Mill does not support discarding conventional moral values, as they often promote happiness for the majority.Choice D is incorrect; while Mill values social happiness, he does not argue that norms should always be followed regardless of context."}
