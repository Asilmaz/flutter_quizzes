{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, in Fear and Trembling, explored the concept of faith through the story of Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac out of obedience to God. Kierkegaard argued that true faith requires a \u201cleap,\u201d a suspension of ethical norms, where the individual acts in absolute trust beyond rational understanding, even if it defies conventional morality.", "text2": "Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, criticized traditional religious faith, arguing that individuals must create their own values rather than submitting to a higher authority. Nietzsche believed that relying on faith or divine command weakens personal autonomy, and he promoted the idea of the \u201c\u00dcbermensch,\u201d a figure who transcends societal norms and forges their own path.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Nietzsche (Text 2) likely respond to Kierkegaard\u2019s (Text 1) idea that true faith requires an individual to act beyond rational understanding and ethical norms? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that faith involves a leap beyond rationality, and that submitting to a higher authority is essential for creating personal values.", "B": "By arguing that only rational understanding should guide actions, and that neither faith nor personal values are relevant to moral decision-making.", "C": "By asserting that the concept of faith is essential for true autonomy and that ethical norms should always be suspended in favor of divine commands.", "D": "By suggesting that reliance on faith undermines autonomy and that individuals should reject absolute trust in external commands to create their own values and transcend traditional norms.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Nietzsche would argue that reliance on faith and external authority undermines individual autonomy, and he would encourage individuals to reject absolute trust in higher commands in favor of creating their own values.Choice A is incorrect; Nietzsche does not support submission to a higher authority for value creation.Choice C is incorrect; Nietzsche would not support faith as essential for autonomy or suggest ethical norms be suspended for divine commands.Choice D is incorrect; while Nietzsche values rationality, he emphasizes the creation of personal values over blind adherence to reason alone."}
