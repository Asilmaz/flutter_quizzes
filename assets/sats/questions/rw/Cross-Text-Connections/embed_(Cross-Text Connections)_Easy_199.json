{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan, argued that in a \u201cstate of nature,\u201d without any form of government or social contract, human life would be \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\u201d Hobbes believed that to escape this condition, individuals must agree to surrender certain freedoms and submit to an absolute authority that ensures peace and security for all.", "text2": "Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in The Social Contract, proposed that humans are inherently good but corrupted by society. Rousseau believed that true freedom could be achieved through a social contract in which individuals collectively agree to be governed by the \u201cgeneral will,\u201d promoting the common good rather than individual interests.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rousseau (Text 2) likely respond to Hobbes\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that absolute authority is necessary to escape the chaos of the \u201cstate of nature\u201d? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that while social order is important, individuals should submit to a general will that represents the common good, rather than to an absolute authority that suppresses individual freedom.", "B": "By agreeing that an absolute authority is the only way to ensure peace and security in society.", "C": "By asserting that humans should remain in a state of nature to preserve absolute freedom, rejecting any form of government or collective decision-making.", "D": "By arguing that any form of authority, even if derived from the general will, is unnecessary for maintaining social order and individual freedom.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rousseau would argue that while social order is essential, it should be achieved through the collective general will that prioritizes the common good, rather than through an absolute authority that limits individual freedom.Choice A is incorrect; Rousseau does not believe in submitting to an absolute authority, favoring the general will instead.Choice C is incorrect; Rousseau supports the idea of a social contract and collective governance, not a complete return to the state of nature.Choice D is incorrect; Rousseau values collective decision-making through the general will as a means to maintain freedom and social order."}
