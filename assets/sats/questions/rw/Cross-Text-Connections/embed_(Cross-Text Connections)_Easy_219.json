{"introduction": "", "text": "In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill argued for the importance of individual freedom, asserting that society should only limit a person\u2019s actions if they harm others. Mill believed that individuality is essential for progress and that suppressing dissent stifles intellectual and moral growth within a society.", "text2": "In Politics, Aristotle argued that individuals are naturally social beings who achieve their fullest potential by participating in a well-ordered community. Aristotle emphasized the role of laws and collective governance in ensuring the common good, suggesting that unchecked individualism can disrupt societal harmony.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Aristotle (Text 2) likely respond to Mill\u2019s (Text 1) argument that individual freedom should only be limited to prevent harm to others? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that dissent and individuality are inherently harmful to the cohesion of a well-ordered community.", "B": "By arguing that prioritizing individuality over the collective good weakens the stability and moral fabric of a community.", "C": "By agreeing that individual freedom is vital but must be balanced with laws that promote the common good in society.", "D": "By asserting that laws should focus solely on preventing harm to others, as collective governance thrives on individual freedom.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "A is the best answer. Aristotle would likely agree that individual freedom has value but would emphasize the need for balance with laws that ensure the common good, as his philosophy centers on harmony within a community.Choice B is incorrect; while Aristotle values the collective good, he does not entirely dismiss the importance of individuality.Choice C is incorrect; this response aligns more closely with Mill\u2019s philosophy, as Aristotle does not prioritize individual freedom over societal needs.Choice D is incorrect; Aristotle does not argue that individuality and dissent are inherently harmful, but rather that they must coexist with laws for the common good."}
