{"introduction": "", "text": "In 1920, physicist Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated how light interacts with matter, revolutionizing our understanding of quantum physics.", "text2": "Historian of science Gerald Holton argues that while Einstein\u2019s work on relativity is celebrated, his contributions to quantum mechanics were equally foundational, influencing multiple fields of science.", "question": "Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement about Einstein\u2019s work? Provide a justification for your answer.", "A": "Einstein\u2019s primary contributions were in theoretical mathematics.", "B": "Einstein\u2019s work was limited to physics, with no interdisciplinary influence.", "C": "Einstein\u2019s work on relativity had no impact on modern science.", "D": "Einstein\u2019s contributions to quantum mechanics were groundbreaking.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Both texts highlight Einstein\u2019s groundbreaking contributions to quantum mechanics, with Text 2 emphasizing its broad influence.Choice A is incorrect; both texts discuss physics, not purely mathematics.Choice C is incorrect; both authors imply his work was highly impactful.Choice D is incorrect; Text 2 notes interdisciplinary influence."}
