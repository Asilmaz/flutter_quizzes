	"introduction": "",
	"text": "Text 1: Some researchers attribute the desertification of the Sahara primarily to human activity by Neolithic pastoralists, whose livestock reportedly degraded vegetation over time.",
	"text2": "Text 2: Other archaeologists have found that the Sahara’s climate may have changed earlier than previously assumed, suggesting that human activity may have delayed rather than caused desertification through selective grazing strategies that conserved plant life.",
	"question": "Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 respond to the claim that Neolithic herders were the primary cause of the Sahara’s desertification?",
	"A": "They would likely consider it incomplete, as new data suggests climate factors may have been decisive and human activity somewhat protective.",
	"B": "They would likely deny that the Sahara experienced desertification during Neolithic times.",
	"C": "They would probably agree fully and propose additional evidence to strengthen that claim.",
	"D": "They would dismiss all previous data on climate change as unreliable.",
	"correct": "A",
	"explanation": "Choice A is correct because Text 2 points out that newer timelines indicate a shift in climate began sooner, meaning human efforts might have even slowed the process instead of causing it. The other options do not match the reasoning in Text 2."
