{"introduction": "", "text": "In studying the landscapes depicted in Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s desert paintings, art historian Roxana Robinson noted that O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s works often reflect an intense, almost spiritual connection to the natural world. Robinson believes that O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s attention to color and form expresses a deep admiration for the harsh beauty of the desert.", "text2": "In her analysis of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work, critic Sarah Green suggests that the artist\u2019s desert paintings should not only be seen as portrayals of nature but also as reflections of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s inner world, using the desert as a metaphor for isolation and resilience.", "question": "Based on the texts, what would Sarah Green (Text 2) most likely say about Robinson\u2019s (Text 1) interpretation of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s paintings?", "A": "The beauty of the desert in O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s paintings is enhanced by abstract techniques.", "B": "The paintings primarily reflect O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s desire to capture realistic desert landscapes.", "C": "O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s choice of colors may reveal her admiration for other artists, not only nature.", "D": "O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s paintings are more about her personal experiences than about the desert itself.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Green\u2019s view that O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s paintings use the desert as a metaphor for personal themes suggests she would agree that the works are more about O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s inner experiences than the landscape itself.Choice A is incorrect; Green does not view O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work as purely realistic.Choice C is incorrect; admiration for other artists is not mentioned.Choice D is incorrect; abstraction is not discussed in either text."}
