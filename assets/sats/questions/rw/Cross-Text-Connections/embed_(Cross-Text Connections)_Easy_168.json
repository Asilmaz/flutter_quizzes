{"introduction": "", "text": "Sociologist Max Weber argued in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism that cultural beliefs, particularly those rooted in religion, play a significant role in shaping economic behavior. Weber believed that the Protestant ethic of hard work, thrift, and efficiency was instrumental in the development of modern capitalism, as it encouraged individuals to see economic success as a sign of virtue.", "text2": "Economist Karl Marx, in contrast, argued in Das Kapital that economic systems are determined by material conditions rather than cultural or religious beliefs. Marx believed that capitalism arose from changes in modes of production and class structures, asserting that economic behavior is primarily influenced by material needs and the relationship between labor and capital, rather than by cultural or religious values.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Marx (Text 2) likely respond to Weber\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that religious beliefs contributed to the development of capitalism?
