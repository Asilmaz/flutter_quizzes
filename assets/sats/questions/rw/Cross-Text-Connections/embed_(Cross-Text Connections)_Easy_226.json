{"introduction": "", "text": "In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau argues that legitimate political authority arises from a social contract in which individuals collectively agree to be governed for the common good. Rousseau emphasizes the idea of the general will, which reflects the collective interests of all citizens and must guide governance to ensure equality and freedom.", "text2": "In Two Treatises of Government, John Locke asserts that legitimate authority is derived from the consent of the governed, with a focus on protecting individual rights, including life, liberty, and property. Locke emphasizes the need for limited government and argues that citizens have the right to overthrow a government that fails to protect their fundamental rights.", "question": "Based on the texts, how might Rousseau (Text 1) critique Locke\u2019s (Text 2) emphasis on individual rights as the foundation of legitimate authority? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that Locke\u2019s framework prioritizes property rights over social equality, which Rousseau views as a central goal of governance.", "B": "By agreeing that individual rights are important but criticizing Locke for neglecting the role of the community in establishing a legitimate social contract.", "C": "By suggesting that Locke\u2019s concept of limited government fails to account for the importance of the general will in creating true societal harmony.", "D": "By arguing that Locke\u2019s focus on individual rights undermines the collective good, which Rousseau sees as essential for ensuring equality and freedom.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "A is the best answer. Rousseau would likely argue that Locke\u2019s emphasis on individual rights could conflict with the general will and collective good, which he believes are essential for true equality and freedom.Choice B is incorrect; while Rousseau might critique Locke\u2019s limited government, his main concern would center on Locke\u2019s emphasis on individualism over the general will.Choice C is incorrect; while Rousseau values social equality, his critique would more likely focus on Locke\u2019s prioritization of individualism over the collective good rather than specifically property rights.Choice D is incorrect; Rousseau\u2019s critique would not involve agreeing with Locke\u2019s emphasis on individual rights, as his focus is on the collective interests embodied in the general will."}
