{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued in Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals that morality is based on duty and universal principles, rather than personal emotions or outcomes. Kant believed that moral actions must be performed out of respect for a \u201ccategorical imperative,\u201d a rule that one would wish to be universally applicable, regardless of circumstances or personal desires.", "text2": "Philosopher David Hume, however, argued that morality is rooted in human emotions and empathy. In Hume\u2019s view, moral judgments arise from feelings of sympathy and compassion rather than abstract principles. He believed that people are naturally inclined to act morally when they feel empathy for others, making emotions central to ethical decisions rather than duty.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Hume (Text 2) likely respond to Kant\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that morality should be based on universal duty rather than personal emotions? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that moral actions must be based on universal principles, free of emotional influence.", "B": "By asserting that morality has no connection to either empathy or principles.", "C": "By suggesting that morality is better understood through empathy and emotions, as these create a natural basis for ethical decisions rather than rigid duty.", "D": "By arguing that moral actions should be guided solely by self-interest rather than any sense of duty or compassion.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Hume sees morality as stemming from human emotions and empathy, directly opposing Kant\u2019s view that it should be based solely on duty and universal principles.Choice A is incorrect; Hume does not support Kant\u2019s emphasis on duty without emotion.Choice C is incorrect; Hume considers empathy central to morality, not irrelevant.Choice D is incorrect; Hume values compassion, not self-interest, as the foundation of moral actions."}
