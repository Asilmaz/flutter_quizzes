{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre argued in Existentialism is a Humanism that individuals are \u201ccondemned to be free,\u201d meaning they bear complete responsibility for defining their own essence and making choices. Sartre believed that, without any predetermined purpose, each person must create their values and purpose, which leads to authentic living through personal responsibility.", "text2": "Philosopher Albert Camus, in The Myth of Sisyphus, explored the idea of the absurd, stating that life has no inherent meaning. Camus believed that recognizing this absurdity should lead individuals to embrace life fully and live with passion, rather than seeking external meaning. For Camus, the response to life\u2019s lack of meaning is to live defiantly and create significance through personal experiences.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Camus (Text 2) likely respond to Sartre\u2019s (Text 1) idea that individuals must create their own values and bear responsibility for their choices? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that individuals should seek predetermined values and avoid personal responsibility.", "B": "By asserting that life has a defined purpose that everyone should follow.", "C": "By suggesting that while life lacks inherent meaning, individuals should embrace their freedom to create personal significance through passionate living, even if that doesn\u2019t imply strict responsibility.", "D": "By arguing that individual choices are irrelevant, as all meaning is determined by external authority.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
