{"introduction": "", "text": "Physicist Niels Bohr proposed that light has a dual nature, behaving as both a particle and a wave, depending on the type of experiment conducted. Bohr argued that this duality challenges the traditional, fixed views of physics, suggesting that reality is more complex than simple categories allow.", "text2": "Physicist Albert Einstein, although a pioneer in quantum mechanics, was skeptical of Bohr\u2019s interpretation. Einstein believed that underlying principles should govern the behavior of particles and waves consistently, rather than relying on experimental context. He famously remarked that he couldn\u2019t believe in a theory that allowed randomness, preferring the search for a more predictable model.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Einstein (Text 2) likely respond to Bohr\u2019s (Text 1) theory of light\u2019s duality? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that light should behave consistently, regardless of experimental conditions, reflecting underlying laws.", "B": "By asserting that light\u2019s behavior is entirely random and lacks any pattern.", "C": "By agreeing that light\u2019s behavior changes based on experimental context, embracing uncertainty.", "D": "By claiming that light cannot be studied meaningfully through experiments.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Einstein disagreed with Bohr\u2019s acceptance of light\u2019s dual behavior based on experimental context, preferring a consistent and predictable model that could explain light\u2019s behavior universally.Choice A is incorrect; Einstein was critical of theories that embraced uncertainty and randomness.Choice C is incorrect; Einstein valued experiments, though he questioned their interpretation.Choice D is incorrect; while Einstein disliked randomness, he sought consistent patterns in physical behavior."}
