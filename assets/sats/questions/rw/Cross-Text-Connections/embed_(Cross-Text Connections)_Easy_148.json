{"introduction": "", "text": "Physicist Werner Heisenberg argued that the behavior of particles at the quantum level cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, a principle known as the \u201cuncertainty principle.\u201d In his view, this inherent unpredictability challenges the idea of deterministic laws in physics, suggesting that probability is a fundamental aspect of the natural world rather than a limitation of human knowledge.", "text2": "Physicist Albert Einstein, however, was a staunch advocate of deterministic principles. Although he recognized the utility of quantum mechanics, Einstein famously remarked, \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe,\u201d indicating his belief that the universe is governed by precise, underlying laws that are simply not yet understood, rejecting the idea that probability is inherent in nature.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Einstein (Text 2) likely respond to Heisenberg\u2019s (Text 1) acceptance of probability as a fundamental part of nature? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By agreeing that probability is an essential aspect of understanding the natural world.", "B": "By asserting that quantum mechanics has no relevance to the behavior of particles.", "C": "By suggesting that while probability is useful, the universe ultimately operates according to deterministic laws that we have yet to fully comprehend.", "D": "By arguing that uncertainty and probability should be completely removed from scientific study.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Einstein believes that while probability is helpful in current models, he views the universe as operating under deterministic principles that have not yet been fully discovered, contrasting with Heisenberg\u2019s belief in inherent uncertainty.Choice A is incorrect; Einstein does not accept probability as a fundamental property of nature.Choice C is incorrect; Einstein acknowledges quantum mechanics but does not agree with its probabilistic interpretation.Choice D is incorrect; Einstein does not dismiss probability entirely, but he views it as a temporary tool rather than an ultimate truth."}
