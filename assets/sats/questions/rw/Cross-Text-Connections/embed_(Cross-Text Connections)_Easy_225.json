{"introduction": "", "text": "In Silent Spring, Rachel Carson highlights the dangers of unregulated pesticide use, particularly focusing on the long-term environmental consequences. She warns that pesticides like DDT not only harm wildlife but also enter human food chains, posing significant health risks. Carson advocates for stricter regulations and more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.", "text2": "In Walden, Henry David Thoreau reflects on his life in solitude near Walden Pond, emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature. Thoreau critiques society\u2019s excessive focus on materialism and advocates for a simpler, more deliberate lifestyle, rooted in environmental awareness and self-reliance.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Thoreau (Text 2) most likely respond to Carson\u2019s (Text 1) concerns about pesticide use and environmental degradation? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By arguing that Carson\u2019s focus on pesticide regulation does not address the root problem, which is society\u2019s detachment from living harmoniously with nature.", "B": "By agreeing that society\u2019s disregard for nature has led to harmful consequences, while emphasizing the need for individuals to reconnect with simpler, more natural lifestyles to prevent such issues.", "C": "By asserting that the reliance on industrial agriculture and chemicals like pesticides is a symptom of modern materialism, which must be rejected in favor of self-reliant, sustainable living.", "D": "By suggesting that Carson overemphasizes regulation when the true solution lies in individuals\u2019 moral and philosophical reconnection with nature.", "correct": "C", "explanation": "C is the best answer. Thoreau would likely view pesticide use as a reflection of society\u2019s materialistic tendencies and advocate for self-reliant, sustainable living as a solution to environmental degradation.Choice A is incorrect; while Thoreau supports living simply, he would likely frame the issue more critically as a symptom of materialism rather than merely endorsing reconnection with nature.Choice B is incorrect; Thoreau would likely agree with Carson\u2019s focus on pesticide regulation but see it as insufficient without addressing broader societal issues.Choice D is incorrect; Thoreau would likely agree that moral reconnection is important, but he would emphasize systemic change over individual moral solutions."}
