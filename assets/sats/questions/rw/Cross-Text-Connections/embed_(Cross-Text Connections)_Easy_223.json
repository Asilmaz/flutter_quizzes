{"introduction": "", "text": "In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill advocates for the protection of individual freedoms, emphasizing that society should only restrict personal liberty to prevent harm to others. Mill highlights the importance of free speech, arguing that open discussion leads to the pursuit of truth and societal progress, even if some opinions are unpopular or offensive.", "text2": "In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau explores the relationship between individual freedom and the collective good. He asserts that individuals must submit to the general will, a collectively agreed-upon standard that ensures equality and justice for all, even at the expense of personal liberties.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Rousseau (Text 2) most likely respond to Mill\u2019s (Text 1) assertion that individual freedoms should only be restricted to prevent harm to others? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that Mill\u2019s focus on free speech overlooks the need for consensus in a well-functioning society, where personal liberties must align with collective goals.", "B": "By agreeing that restrictions on personal liberty should focus on harm prevention but emphasizing that these limits should also protect societal equality and justice.", "C": "By asserting that individual freedoms are less important than Mill suggests because the general will inherently promotes justice for everyone.", "D": "By arguing that Mill underestimates the importance of the general will, which prioritizes collective harmony over individual freedoms in ensuring societal stability.", "correct": "D", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Rousseau would likely argue that Mill\u2019s focus on individual liberty overlooks the critical role of the general will in maintaining collective harmony and stability, even if it requires sacrificing some personal freedoms.Choice A is incorrect; while Rousseau values societal equality, he would not frame it in terms of harm prevention alone but as part of the general will.Choice C is incorrect; Rousseau does not entirely dismiss the value of individual freedom but prioritizes the collective over the individual.Choice D is incorrect; although Rousseau values consensus, his emphasis would be on the binding nature of the general will, not on aligning liberties with collective goals."}
