{"introduction": "", "text": "Philosopher David Hume argued in A Treatise of Human Nature that human behavior is largely driven by emotions and passions rather than by reason. Hume believed that reason serves as a tool for fulfilling desires but does not motivate actions on its own. In his view, emotions are the true guiding force behind human decisions and interactions.", "text2": "Philosopher Immanuel Kant, however, argued in Critique of Practical Reason that moral decisions must be based on rational principles rather than emotions. Kant believed that individuals should follow a moral law that is universally applicable, independent of personal desires or feelings. He saw reason as the foundation for ethical behavior, as it allows individuals to make choices grounded in duty rather than personal inclination.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Kant (Text 2) likely respond to Hume\u2019s (Text 1) claim that emotions, rather than reason, are the primary drivers of human actions? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By suggesting that rational principles, not emotions, should be the basis for moral and ethical decisions, as reason provides universal guidelines.", "B": "By agreeing that emotions should guide human behavior, as they lead to more authentic actions.", "C": "By asserting that neither emotions nor reason are relevant to moral decision-making.", "D": "By arguing that moral decisions should be based solely on emotions, as reason complicates human actions.", "correct": "A", "explanation": "B is the best answer. Kant believes that moral decisions should be rooted in rational principles and universal duty, contrasting with Hume\u2019s emphasis on emotions as the primary motivators of human actions.Choice A is incorrect; Kant does not agree that emotions should guide human behavior.Choice C is incorrect; Kant considers reason essential to moral decisions, not irrelevant.Choice D is incorrect; Kant argues that moral decisions should be based on duty, not emotions alone."}
