{"introduction": "", "text": "Literary critic Harold Bloom argued that Shakespeare\u2019s works provide profound insights into human nature, portraying complex characters who embody universal emotions and dilemmas.

In Will in the World, Greenblatt argued that understanding the specific societal and political context of Elizabethan England is essential to fully grasp the themes and character motivations in Shakespeare\u2019s works, as these aspects are deeply rooted in their time.", "question": "Based on the texts, how would Greenblatt (Text 2) likely respond to Bloom\u2019s (Text 1) emphasis on Shakespeare\u2019s universal insights into human nature? Use specific reasoning to support your answer.", "A": "By asserting that Shakespeare\u2019s plays have no relevance to human emotions or historical context.", "B": "By suggesting that while Shakespeare\u2019s works offer universal insights, they are also deeply shaped by the cultural and political contexts of his time.", "C": "By agreeing that Shakespeare\u2019s works are entirely timeless and free from historical influence.", "D": "By arguing that understanding Shakespeare\u2019s works requires ignoring all historical context to focus only on universal themes.", "correct": "B", "explanation": "B is the best answer.
