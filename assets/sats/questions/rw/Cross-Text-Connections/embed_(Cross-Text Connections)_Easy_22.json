Kandinsky believes in using symbolic elements within abstraction, contrasting with Bell\u2019s rejection of representation.Choice A is incorrect; Kandinsky values symbolic meaning.Choice C is incorrect; nature is not discussed as a focus for abstract art.Choice D is incorrect; Kandinsky supports abstraction, not necessarily recognizable subjects."}
